<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks at a press conference in Tehran, Iran, on Oct. 14, 2019. (Xinhua/Ahmad Halabisaz)</p>
<p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday that Iran is ready to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia, official IRNA news agency reported. </p>
<p>&#8220;From Iran&#8217;s points of view, there is no problem in developing ties with neighbors and resuming relations with Saudi Arabia,&#8221; Rouhani made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi in Tehran. </p>
<p>&#8220;All the regional countries should stay together in order to create peace and stability in the region,&#8221; Rouhani was quoted as saying. </p>
<p>The Iranian president said that Iran&#8217;s Hormuz Peace Initiative is aimed at bringing regional countries together to create stability. </p>
<p>&#8220;We should establish security in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz through expanding our cooperation and preventing foreign powers to interfere,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Rouhani disclosed the initiative at the recent meeting of the 74th UN General Assembly. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Rouhani said that &#8220;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon failed to bear fruits.&#8221; He urged the Saudi authorities to change their course of action vis-a-vis regional countries. </p>
<p>Rouhani noted that Iran and Saudi Arabia need to leave aside their feud and look ahead to solve regional problems through cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />More than 500 Syrian refugees returned on Tuesday to their homeland from Lebanon, the National News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Syrian refugees from different areas in Lebanon, including Burj Hammoud, Tripoli, Bekaa, Nabatieh and other regions, returned to their homeland by bus under the supervision of the Lebanese general security.</p>
<p>More than one million Syrian refugees are registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon, while the Lebanese government estimated the true number of Syrians in the country at 1.5 million.</p>
<p>Lebanese President Michel Aoun has been working hard with the international community to secure the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland due to the negative impact of their stay in Lebanon on the national economy.</p>
<p>The president has previously announced that around 390,000 Syrian refugees have so far returned to Syria.</p>

<p>Lebanon has been witnessing protests against the ruling political class and their corrupt practices for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Protests have so far succeeded in toppling the government while protesters vowed not to leave the streets until they see a formation of a new cabinet capable of dealing with their demands including the trial of corrupted politicians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Iraqi parliament on Sunday approved the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, as demonstrations continue in the country, the Iraqi official television reported.</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s lawmakers voted to accept Abdul Mahdi&#8217;s resignation after reading his letter of resignation during the session, state-run Iraqiya channel said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The President of Iraq will be informed to nominate a new prime minister in accordance with the constitution&#8217;s Article 76,&#8221; said Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi.</p>
<p>The parliament extraordinary session was held in the afternoon to discuss the protests and the security situation in the provinces of Dhi Qar and Najaf in southern Iraq, as well as Abdul Mahdi&#8217;s resignation.</p>
<p>Abdul Mahdi&#8217;s resignation came more than a year after he was sworn in as Iraqi prime minister on Oct. 25, 2018.</p>
<p>On Friday, Abdul Mahdi announced that he would submit his resignation to the parliament in response to anti-government protests.</p>
<p>According to the Iraqi constitution, the largest coalition in parliament should nominate a candidate for the vacant post to President Barham Salih who will task the new prime minister-designate to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>The prime minister-designate has 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval. The parliament must approve each minister in separate absolute majority votes.</p>
<p>Mass demonstrations have continued in the capital Baghdad and other cities in central and southern Iraq since early October, demanding comprehensive reform, fight against corruption, better public services and more job opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iran warned Sunday it may &#8220;seriously reconsider&#8221; its commitments to the UN atomic watchdog if European parties to a nuclear deal trigger a dispute mechanism that could lead to sanctions.</p>
<p>The 2015 nuclear accord has been unravelling since last year when the US unilaterally withdrew from it and began reimposing sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>The three European countries still party to the deal &#8211; Britain, France and Germany &#8211; have been trying to salvage it but their efforts have so far borne little fruit.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they use the trigger [mechanism], Iran would be forced to seriously reconsider some of its commitments to&#8221; the International Atomic Energy Agency, said parliament speaker Ali Larijani.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they think doing so is more beneficial to them, they can go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May, one year after the US pullout, Iran began retaliating by scaling back its commitments to the deal &#8211; known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).</p>
<p>Following its latest step back this month, the European parties warned the JCPOA&#8217;s dispute resolution mechanism could be triggered if Iran continued down that path.</p>
<p>Larijani also suggested the current deadlock with the US could be &#8220;fixed&#8221; if Iran&#8217;s arch-foe learns from the past.</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2015 deal, then US president Barack &#8220;Obama wrote a letter and said that I accept Iran&#8217;s enrichment, now let&#8217;s negotiate,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the American officials have just as much wisdom, to use past experiences, then they can fix this issue.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Adel Abdel Mahdi Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s parliament on Sunday approved the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi&#8217;s government after two months of protests that have left more than 420 people dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The premier said Friday he would submit his resignation to parliament after a dramatic intervention by the country&#8217;s Shiite spiritual leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani following a spree of violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The speaker of parliament said Sunday he would now ask President Barham Salih to name a new prime minister.</p>
<p>Iraqis across the country marched ­Sunday to mourn protesters killed in anti-government rallies, even turning out in Sunni areas where people were previously too afraid to join in.</p>
<p>Demonstrators have hit the streets since early October in Baghdad and the Shiite-majority south to demand the ouster of a government they accuse of being corrupt, inefficient and beholden to foreign powers.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, most Sunni-majority areas refrained from protesting, fearing it would earn them the labels of being &#8220;terrorists&#8221; or supporters of ex-dictator Saddam Hussein.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after a spike in violence days ago left nearly 70 people dead across three cities, Iraqis in nearly all provinces turned out in solidarity.</p>
<p>In Sunday&#8217;s marches, hundreds of students dressed in black organized a mourning march in the northern city of Mosul, on the city&#8217;s university campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the least Mosul can give to the martyrs of Dhi Qar and Najaf,&#8221; said Zahraa Ahmed, a dentistry student, naming the two provinces where most recent victims were from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For three years, Mosul was the heart of the Islamic State group&#8217;s ultraconservative &#8220;caliphate,&#8221; and much of it still lies in ruins today.</p>
<p>And eight other Shiite-majority provinces announced Sunday a mourning day during which government offices would remain shut.</p>
<p>More than 20 people were killed in the shrine city of Najaf, 40 people in the hot spot of Nasiriyah and three in the capital Baghdad.</p>
<p>The protest hot spot is the birthplace of Abdel Mahdi, who came to power just a year ago based on a shaky alliance between rival parties.</p>
<p>He had resisted protesters&#8217; calls for him to step down over the past two months.&nbsp;</p>

<br />In one of the verdant highland villages of Haraaz area, about 100 km west of the Yemeni capital Sanaa, farmers have begun to harvest coffee crop, amid tough challenges they face due to the raging war.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mainly rely on the rainy season to irrigate coffee plants since the war broke out more than four years ago, which cut electricity and triggered severe fuel shortage,&#8221; farmer Mohsen Al-Hamassi told Xinhua at his coffee farm in al-Hutib village east of Haraaz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuel prices on the black market have tripled, making it difficult for many farmers to run their own irrigation water pumps, and the solar energy to run the water pumps is very expensive,&#8221; he said, adding that only some can afford buying solar energy system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Yemeni coffee is highly sought after in the international markets due to its well-known high quality and delicious taste, but the prolonged conflict and all-out blockade have prevented farmers from increasing the production and exporting their crop abroad.</p>
<p>However, despite these challenges, the farmers have been trying to keep the tempo of coffee agriculture and production.</p>
<p>The Yemenis were the first to export coffee hundreds of years ago, through once a thriving Red Sea port of Mocha, also known as al-Mokha, about 250 km west of Haraaz.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Mocha port now serves as a military base for the Saudi-led military coalition forces, which support the troops of the Yemeni government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against the Iran-allied Houthi rebel group.</p>
<p>The coalition forces recaptured the port in July last year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Al-Hamassi, 55, inherited the farm from his father, where his ancestors had grown coffee for hundreds of years. Al-Hamassi&#8217;s family is one of thousands of Yemeni families that entirely rely on coffee cultivation to earn a living.</p>
<p>Yemenis call the coffee beans &#8220;red rubies&#8221; and the farmers chant folk songs loudly during the harvest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />After collecting the red coffee beans from the trees and packing them in plastic bags, the farmers carry them on their backs and put them in pickup trucks, which then transport the crop through rugged mountain roads to nearby locations where the crop is unloaded in large open containers intended for drying the crop in the sun.</p>
<p>After drying the crop for several days, the farmers then pack the crop in bags and sell them to local traders who transport the beans to the peeling and grinding plants and sell the coffee powder to local retailers and exporters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Coffee is one of the most important Yemeni products, but the ongoing war has badly affected farmers and coffee growing, and caused production to decline.</p>
<p>Yasmin, a student at Sanaa University, said the coffee is an Arab symbol of hospitality during the reception of guests and a symbol of love during family activities. She compared the feeling of drinking coffee to the pleasure of reading a book, drawing classical art or listening to music.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet Yemeni coffee is good to the last drop,&#8221; Yasmin added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />Scores of people gathered on Saturday to mark and celebrate the anniversary of the national independence day in Yemen&#8217;s southern port city of Aden.</p>
<p>The public celebration was organized by the Aden-based Southern Transitional Council (STC) to mark the 52nd anniversary of the 129 years of occupation of the country&#8217;s south by the British troops, which ended on November 30, 1967.</p>
<p>Citizens from different neighborhoods of Aden and neighboring southern provinces attended the celebration that took place on a main street in the strategic city.</p>
<p> <br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Teams of the cultural department in Aden participated in the celebration and performed a number of traditional styles in the area.</p>
<p>Ahmed Jalal, one of the celebration&#8217;s organizers, told Xinhua that people in the southern provinces of Yemen attended to celebrate the departure of the British from their regions amid hopes to achieve a noticeable change in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;During this occasion, the people in southern regions are still aspiring to get better living conditions to change their lives into more development away from the recent crises,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />In August, forces loyal to the Aden-based STC engaged in intense street fighting with the government forces over the control of Aden and other neighboring southern provinces.</p>
<p>The STC seized all the state institutions after defeating the Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces during Aden battles.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia persuaded the STC and Yemen&#8217;s government to hold reconciliation talks, which succeeded in reaching a deal to form a new technocrat cabinet of no more than 24 ministers earlier this month.</p>
<p> <br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The main points of the deal also included the return of the exiled Yemeni government to Aden and the unification of all military units under the authority of the ministries of interior and defense.</p>
<p>The Saudi-brokered deal excluded the Iranian-backed Houthis who are still controlling the capital Sanaa and other northern provinces of the war-torn Arab country.</p>
<p>The impoverished Arab country has been locked in a civil war since late 2014, when the Houthis overran much of the country and seized all northern areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />An immigration reception center in the southern Libyan city of Kurfa on Thursday announced the deportation of 140 illegal immigrants to their home countries. </p>
<p>&#8220;140 illegal immigrants of the center have been deported to Chad and Sudan,&#8221; the center said in a statement. </p>
<p>The illegal immigrants have been deported in coordination with the governments of their home countries, the statement said. </p>
<p>Thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly Africans, choose to cross the Mediterranean Sea towards Europe from Libya as the country has been mired in insecurity and chaos ever since the fall of its former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. </p>
<p>According to the International Organization for Migration, over 600,000 illegal immigrants are in Libya, &#8220;many of whom are in need of assistance especially as conflict continues.&#8221; </p>
<p>Shelters in Libya are crowded with thousands of migrants rescued at sea or arrested by the Libyan security services, despite international calls to close those centers.</p>
