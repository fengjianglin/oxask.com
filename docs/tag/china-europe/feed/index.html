<br />Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin inaugurated the China-Russia east route natural gas pipeline by video link-up on Monday sending a signal that energy and cooperation in other sectors between the two countries are becoming the key to boosting multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering service the same day, the pipeline will help Russia export up to 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to China, according to an article posted on the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) website on Monday.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s almost one-third of China&#8217;s total natural gas imports in 2018. About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020 and will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the article said.</p>
<p>CNPC is responsible for the construction and management of the project within China: Stretching from Russia&#8217;s Siberia to China&#8217;s Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers 8,000 kilometers, of which 5,111 kilometers fall within Chinese borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project extends from Heihe in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province to North China&#8217;s Hebei Province and finally to Shanghai in East China across a total of nine provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>Russia will deliver a total 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the 30 years of contract, media reports said.</p>
<p>Following 20 years of negotiations, China and Russia reached the more than $400 billion contract in May 2014, the CNPC article read.</p>
<p>A China-Russia west route and China-Far East pipelines are also under discussion, the article said.</p>

<p>
<strong>Win-win deal</p>
<p></strong>Mutual benefit drove the two countries&#8217; energy development strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &#8220;rapidly rising China needs a stable and reliable energy supply, while an increasingly powerful Russia also needs to participate in the world&#8217;s largest market,&#8221; the CNPC article said.</p>
<p>The pipeline will help stabilize China&#8217;s natural gas supply and guarantee the country&#8217;s energy security, especially if the situation ever changes for ocean transportation of natural gas in certain waters like the South China Sea, Jin Lei, an associate professor at the Beijing-based China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>The construction of the pipeline fits the country&#8217;s strategic energy blueprint, Jin noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline system in northwestern China, a China-Myanmar oil and gas pipeline in the southwestern region and about 20 liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the eastern region,&#8221; Jin said.</p>
<p>The construction of the China-Russia pipeline will make up for the lack of a cross-border natural gas pipeline in northeastern China, he said, noting that the China-Russia pipe is a strategic energy supply channel.</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest natural gas importer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, China imported 90.39 million tons (about 125.9 billion cubic meters) of natural gas, data from the General Administration of Customs shows.</p>
<p>The annual import of 38 billion cubic meters from Russia would account for nearly one-third of China&#8217;s annual total natural gas imports, and Russia is expected to be China&#8217;s largest supplier.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chinese demand, the pipeline will become an important channel for Russian exports, Jin said, especially if problems impede Russia&#8217;s natural gas export to Western Europe.</p>
<p>Europe is a big export market for Russian gas, with Gazprom alone exporting about 202 billion cubic meters to European countries and Turkey in 2018, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those exports can suffer during political tensions.</p>
<p>The US and European countries oppose construction of Nord Stream 2, a Russian gas pipeline to Western Europe, over security concerns, The Los Angeles Times reported in June.</p>
<p>As a major resources export economy, Russia saw its natural gas production hit a record 725 billion cubic meters in 2018, of which 225 billion cubic meters were exported, Xinhua reported in January, citing Russian energy minister Alexander Novak.</p>
<p>The project deepens China-Russia relations, Chinese observers noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has become a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades, noted Wang Yiwei, a director of China&#8217;s Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.</p>
<p>China-Russia energy and financial cooperation boosts multilateralism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia is not only a business partner, but more of a strategic partner in politics and diplomacy,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the pipeline project will step up China-Russia cooperation in other aspects including regional cooperation and cyber-security, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the international backdrop that the US continues to contain China by even sacrificing its own interests, China supporting Russia is supporting itself,&#8221; Wang said.</p>

<p>When Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met with High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini in late October, he expressed hopes both sides could complete China-Europe investment agreement negotiations next year as scheduled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a positive signal to the world against the backdrop of the China-US trade war, enduring trade conflicts between the US and European countries, rising protectionism, unilateralism and anti-globalization. As a result, people have regained confidence in the development of China-Europe relations and the improvement of world trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The China-Europe economic relationship had faltered for some time, especially when the &#8220;EU-China &#8211; A strategic outlook&#8221; released in March, for the first time, formally labeled China an economic &#8220;systemic rival&#8221; and a &#8220;strategic competitor.&#8221; Faced with stark comparisons between China&#8217;s rapid economic development and EU&#8217;s own, the EU has been overburdened by excessive anxiety and has adopted anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, while establishing an investment review mechanism to achieve market distortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, China is required to &#8220;fully reciprocate&#8221; on bilateral economic and trade activities. It is wrong and illogical for the EU to take such a confrontational approach instead of cooperating to resolve the matter. The latest progress on China-Europe investment agreement negotiations provides the world a revelation on how to handle economic and trade frictions between different economies while maintaining a dynamic balance between developed and emerging economies.</p>
<p>China-EU economic and trade cooperation has a solid foundation and bright prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, unlike the US, which has defined China as a strategic competitor, a conflict between China and Europe in terms of strategy, structure and geopolitics does not exist.</p>
<p>Second, China and the EU have identical or similar positions in many aspects of global governance on multilateralism, free trade, climate change and environmental protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, both have a mutual understanding and dependence on the world economy and bilateral relations are characterized by mutual benefit through cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, cooperation between China-EU, China-EU member states, and China-EU sub-regions has developed over the years. More than 50 economic and trade dialogue and consultation mechanisms, including the China-EU High-level Economic and Trade Dialogue, provide a solid infrastructure and institutional guarantee for bilateral exchanges.</p>
<p>Most importantly, China has given a positive and pragmatic response to economic and trade concerns raised by developed economies, including the EU, from the government&#8217;s position to specific actions. In response to concerns about market access, intellectual property protection and compulsory technology transfer, the Chinese government has implemented measures that have shortened the negative list of foreign investment access by adding free trade pilot zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investment restrictions in manufacturing, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery industries were largely eliminated. With the promulgation of the new Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors are given national treatment and 100 percent ownership in certain industries where ownership caps previously applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China continues to prohibit compulsory technology transfer and strengthen intellectual property protection. By eliminating remittance restrictions, China has committed to opening up the capital market further, which has significantly improved the business environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2019 World Bank ranking of the Global Business Environment Index shows China jumped from 78th in 2017 to 31st. The improvement of China-EU economic and trade relations can also be seen as the result of China&#8217;s practical actions.</p>
<p>As globalization faces a headwind amid US trade protectionism and economic bullying, the EU should accept how China is at a different development stage, respect China&#8217;s development rights, and use positive and constructive consultations rather than pressure to deal with bilateral economic and trade issues. Once this is achieved, both sides could embark on a road of cooperation that would benefit their people and the interests of all countries involved.</p>

<p>Right after Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis ended his trip to China in early November,&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping embarked on a reciprocal three-day trip to Greece on Sunday. Such high-level exchanges within a short period have drawn widespread attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newly elected Greek government, formed by center-right New Democracy party, is making efforts to attract more foreign investment and promote economic reforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a time when Europeans were worried Greece could exit the EU due to the debt crisis. Fortunately, Greek economic recovery has stood out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China has to some extent brought benefit to the country. For example, the Piraeus Port project located in the Athens urban area has received massive investments from the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) and hundreds of local people are working at the port, including administrative staff and employees; only a few Chinese can be spotted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greece&#8217;s economy is still relatively weak now. Economic recovery is the most crucial task for Greece. Boosting ties with China is closely connected with Greek development goals. China&#8217;s investments in the country have continued to increase during these years and both sides are negotiating new projects. This is not only in the interest of Greece and China but is also in line with EU interests &#8211; the bloc would like to see Greece get over its debt crisis and return to the path of healthy development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, political figures in Brussels are concerned about China&#8217;s objective in establishing a cooperation platform with Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The 17+1 initiative (China-CEE countries cooperation initiative) is regarded as China&#8217;s intention to divide and rule the EU. This explains why the EU&#8217;s policy paper &#8220;EU-China &#8211; A strategic outlook,&#8221; released in March, stressed ever more strongly that Europe should speak with one voice when negotiating with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such fear is a reminder to Beijing that when developing cooperation with EU member states, it should make clear in which fields the bloc has exclusive competence and in which areas it shares competence with its member states. This would help promote relations between Beijing and Brussels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the EU and China are highly interdependent on trade and seriously committed to jointly maintaining world peace and sustainable development. The new EU Commission is going to take office before the end of this year. Relations with China will be one of its major priorities. The agreement on the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, which was launched in 2013 and calls for cooperation in the areas of &#8220;peace, prosperity, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges,&#8221; is due next year. At this point, the two sides need to work together to see how to manage differences and disagreements and how to facilitate cooperation for mutual benefit in the long run.</p>
<p>Both the EU and China attach great importance to Eurasian connectivity and are proactively exploring feasible projects on the continent. The Piraeus Port surpassed the port of Valencia, a major port city in eastern Spain, earlier this year, to become the busiest port in the Mediterranean Sea. The success of Piraeus, in which Chinese investment not only brings economic benefits but also increases local employment, may serve as an example of further cooperation between China and Greece as well as between China and Europe.</p>
