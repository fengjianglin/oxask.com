<p>&nbsp;Amid the 80th anniversary of Marvel Comics, a video showing stories of Chinese Marvel fans is circulating on Chinese social media, in which fans talk about the Marvel world as a kind of utopia that can stimulate them to overcome difficulties in real life.</p>
<p>Since 1939, when Marvel was started by Martin Goodman, the comics have spread around the world and 23 films based on Marvel characters have grossed over $22.5 billion at the global box office. Although the comics brand has a long history, it is still young in China, one of the Chinese fans said in the video.</p>
<p>The video shows three Chinese Marvel fans who have different ages and professions but have the same deep love for Marvel.</p>
<p>He Jia, a designer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) who was born in the 1970s, came across Iron Man 11 years ago. He said he was inspired by the symbolic gestures of the hero and he even designed the UAVs belonging to Iron Man that appear in the movies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I researched UAVs, I often entered the world of the comics and imagined myself as Iron Man,&#8221; He said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell that I am more than 40 years old from appearance. Marvel brings young blood to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu Yuze and Hu Tianqi are cover painters for Marvel comics who were born in the 1990s and 2000s. The younger fans have the same feelings as He. &#8220;When you paint these characters, you will feel their mind. I can enter the Marvel world rather than letting characters step out,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>But this does not mean they want to hide in the Marvel universe to avoid difficulties in real life. &#8220;Marvel shows many super heroes to us and although it does not ask us to become one of them, it encourages us to become braver and better ourselves,&#8221; Wu said.</p>
<p>C. B. Cebulski, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, said in July that China has also been brought into the Marvel Universe, according to a report by Xinhua News Agency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />60-year-old Zhang Jinlai, the classic Monkey King for lots of Chinese people, announced on Monday that he will reenact the movie version of Monkey King.</p>
<p>Better known by his stage name Liu Xiao Ling Tong, Zhang&#8217;s announcement of his return to the big screen got some Chinese netizens excited, but also sparked some opposition on social media.</p>
<p>Zhang played the role of Monkey King in the 1986 classic TV series Journey to the West and its later 2000 sequel, which have been recounted in the memories of Chinese netizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;My happiest time of the day was when I sat in front of the TV and watched Journey to the West with my parents after dinner,&#8221; commented one netizen on Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>The new movie, also called Journey to the West, is directed by Han Yan, director of Animal World, and will use the technology of motion capture to finish the Monkey King&#8217;s filming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monkey King is the earliest hero in my mind and I grew up with him,&#8221; Han said when asked on social media why he shot the film about the mythological figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Liu Xiao Ling Tong deserves the title of Monkey King,&#8221; wrote another netizen.</p>
<p>Many netizens said that they will support the movie when it is released to &#8220;pay tribute to this classic from their younger years.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, some netizens worried that Zhang is unfit for high-intensity filming at his age. &#8220;He should take care of his health,&#8221; a Sina Weibo user commented.</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s compelling performance in Journey to the West was greatly praised by critics and helped him win the Best Actor award at the sixth Golden Eagle Awards in 1988.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-top: 3px; color: #999">Poster of <em>The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir</em> Photo: Weibo</p>
<p>Widespread praise on Chinese social media emerged over the weekend over the latest film from Canadian director Ken Scott,<br />
<em>The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir</em>. Many Chinese netizens commented on how the film made them cry, which was released Friday on the Chinese mainland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film follows Indian actor Dhanush, who plays &#8216;Aja,&#8217; a poor man who lives with his single mother. Aja dreams of taking his mother to Paris, but her untimely death prevents him from fulfilling his dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aja sets off for Europe to find his father, embarking on a metaphorical journey through France and parts of Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom, are we very poor?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we are very rich because we have each other.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exchange is just one example of how the film has touched the hearts of Chinese audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best part of the whole film, I think, is when Aja asks his mom if the men he met were his dad,&#8221; commented one Chinese netizen on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as audiences were moved by Aja&#8217;s childhood, many thought his adventures were &#8220;absurd&#8221; and &#8220;chaotic.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film is an adaptation of the best-selling French novel,<br />
<em>The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir Who Got Trapped in an IKEA Wardrobe</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that I was deceived by the movie&#8217;s name. I thought I would see the tragic story of a filial young man going to Paris for his deceased mother, while it turned out to be about a poor man&#8217;s ridiculous adventures traveling through Europe,&#8221; said another Chinese netizen on Douban, a Chinese film review platform.</p>
<p>At different points in Aja&#8217;s journey, he finds himself traveling in an IKEA wardrobe and later in a suitcase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The plot is not logical at all. How could Aja appear in the female celebrity&#8217;s wardrobe without being taken out by security guards? The film misguides young people,&#8221; said another netizen on Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film has a 7.2/10 rating on Douban, and according to China&#8217;s top box office ticket platform Maoyan, earning 3.49 million yuan ($497,361) as of Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film follows a standard Hollywood-Bollywood narrative, outside of the key events that move the story forward, which are coincidental and come across as far-fetched,&#8221; said Shi Wenxue, a Beijing-based film critic and teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, to the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>However, Shi noted the film still had something to offer for Chinese filmmakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The film describes the global phenomenon of refugees and immigrants against a globalized background. This humanistic care that reflects reality is what Chinese film should learn from, especially considering our efforts to bring our films out of China. Telling a &#8216;Chinese story&#8217; is the first step, but telling a good story about China and the world should also be considered,&#8221; Shi said.</p>
<p><em>The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir</em> was released in France on May 30, 2018, and&nbsp;hit the&nbsp;theater in June, 2019&nbsp;in India, the US, Canada, Singapore, and Malaysia.</p>

<p>Chinese young director Diao Yinan&#8217;s latest work<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> held its China premiere on Sunday in Beijing ahead of its nationwide debut on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crime film will compete with Brad Pitt&#8217;s space-themed blockbuster AD Astra and Chinese movie The Whistleblower starring Tang Wei and Lei Jiayin.</p>
<p>Another of the director&#8217;s signature black humor movies,<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> takes place in Wuhan, Central China&#8217;s Hubei Province, and follows a detective who is hunting down a suspect on the run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the premiere, Diao said that the film mainly focuses on people living in the margins of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are often ignored, but we can always find something bright about them. The suspect Zhou Zenong at the begining is running from the reality of life. But one day, he has to face death and a chance to save himself as well. What he faces is a philosophical question which all people must deal with,&#8221; Diao said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disney blockbuster<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> held top spot at the North American box office over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, taking in an estimated $85.2 million, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Sunday.</p>
<p>The animation adventure movie follows the beloved characters from 2013 hit<br />
<em>Frozen</em> as they travel to an ancient, autumn-bound forest in search of the origin of the magical ice powers of Queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel).</p>
<p><em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, which came out just in time for the winter holidays, secured $123.7 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday period from Wednesday to Sunday.</p>
<p>It was a Thanksgiving record, beating<br />
<em>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</em> in 2013, according to Variety.</p>
<p><em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> had pulled in a three-day total of $130.2 million the previous weekend when it was a new release &#8211; the third-best start for an animated film behind fellow Disney titles<br />
<em>Incredibles 2</em> (2018) and<br />
<em>Finding Dory</em> (2016).</p>
<p><em>Knives Out</em>, a murder mystery from Lionsgate starring Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis and Chris Evans, made a surprise $27 million for the Friday-to-Sunday period, and has been immediately hailed as a triumph for its original content at multiplexes.</p>
<p><em>Ford v Ferrari</em> slipped to third place with $13.2 million. The Fox film is based on the true story of how a team at Ford built a car to challenge Ferrari&#8217;s longtime dominance of France&#8217;s classic 24-hour Le Mans race.</p>
<p>Sony release<br />
<em>A Beautiful Day</em><br />
<em>in the Neighborhood</em>, a drama about a journalist&#8217;s relationship with beloved television star Fred Rogers (played by Tom Hanks), took fourth place with $11.8 million.</p>
<p>New Universal release<br />
<em>Queen and Slim</em>, a romantic drama starring Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith, also performed above expectations to earn fifth spot with $11.7 million.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top 10 were:</p>
<p><em>21 Bridges</em> ($5.8 million)</p>
<p><em>Playing with Fire</em> ($4.2 million)</p>
<p><em>Midway</em> ($3.9 million)</p>
<p><em>Joker</em> ($2 million)</p>
<p><em>Last <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a></em> ($1.9 million)</p>

<p>Ten films from the Chinese mainland were randomly selected from a pool of 62 to be released in the island of Taiwan in 2020, while there are no restrictions on films from Taiwan when they are released in the mainland.</p>
<p>The 10 chosen movies include<br />
<em>Vanguard</em>, starring Jackie Chan,<br />
<em>Li Na</em>, directed by Peter Chan, and<br />
<em>Ash is Purest White</em>, which was nominated for the main competition of the 71st Cannes International Film Festival in April 2018, according to a report from the Beijing Evening News.</p>
<p>An additional 52 movies also applied for a Taiwan release, including<br />
<em>Last Later</em>, jointly made by Chinese and Japanese artists, and 27 have been placed on a waiting list. If any of the initially chosen 10 films encounter problems and cannot be broadcast, these 27 movies will have the opportunity to replace them.</p>
<p>A quota system in Taiwan for films from the Chinese mainland means that only 10 movies can be released in Taiwan each year. This quota was initially filled according to a first-come-first-served basis, but as the number of applications increased, the process was changed to a lottery system.</p>
<p>Analysts say the rule leads to the delayed release of popular movies from the Chinese mainland in Taiwan. For example,<br />
<em>Ash is Purest White</em>, which was popular in 2018, will be broadcast in Taiwan after two years when it is already available online.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council published 31 measures to benefit the island of Taiwan in February 2018, which placing no limits on the number of films and TV series produced in Taiwan that can be introduced in the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Xin Zhiyu, a producer of TV dramas from Taiwan, said that the beneficial policy can promote cultural exchanges in film and TV between the island and the mainland, and can offer more relevant work opportunities in Taiwan.</p>

<p>It was announced on Wednesday that Chinese crime drama<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> will hit the mainland cinemas on December 6.</p>
<p>A trailer for the film, which stars Chinese mainland actor Hu Ge and Gwei Lun-mei from the island of Taiwan, was released on the film&#8217;s official Sina Weibo account on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trailer briefly shows a fugitive man Zhou Zhennan (Hu) as he tries to escape the police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a press conference in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, on Tuesday, Hu said that &#8220;The director was patient and gave me a lot of guidance, but the shoot was not easy since the director wanted to dig deeper into the performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film premiered at the 72nd annual<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/983300.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannes Film Festival</a> in competition on May 18. It currently has a 7.6/10 score on Chinese media review site Douban.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a movie, with a unique personal style full of innovations! Each shot of the lens is carefully crafted. Most of the story was shot at night and the chases, fighting and gun battles in this gangster drama also have their own unique expressions. I like this ridiculous story with blurred love and black humor,&#8221; one netizen commented on Douban.&nbsp;</p>

<p>French star Adele Haenel lodged a complaint on Tuesday against a film director she claims sexually harassed her between the ages of 12 and 15, her lawyers said.</p>
<p>The actress shook the French film industry earlier this month with accusations about being repeatedly touched and kissed by Christophe Ruggia, who directed her in her first film role.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old winner of two French Oscars initially refused to bring charges because she said so few sexual assault cases come to court in France. But she changed her mind and went to a police station in a Paris suburb on Tuesday to make a formal complaint against Ruggia.</p>
<p>The director, now 54, initially denied the accusations before asking Haenel to forgive him, saying: &#8220;I did not see that my adulation and the hopes I placed in her, might &#8211; given her young age &#8211; be distressing [for her].&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris prosecutors had already opened a preliminary investigation after she detailed the alleged abuse in a lengthy livestreamed interview to investigative website Mediapart.</p>
<p>The interview was seen as a turning point for the #MeToo movement in France. It helped galvanize renewed criticism of controversial director Roman Polanski, whose new film An Officer and a Spy was released in France earlier this month.</p>
<p>Polanski, who has French citizenship, has been a fugitive from US justice since 1978 after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in a plea bargain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days before his historical thriller opened, a French photographer claimed that Polanski had raped her in 1975 when she was 18 after beating her &#8220;into submission&#8221; at his Swiss chalet.</p>
<p>Valentine Monnier, a former model and actress, said she was pushed to finally speak out when the director compared himself to Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly persecuted as a spy by the French army at the turn of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>
