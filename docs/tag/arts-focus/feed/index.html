<p>Bottega Veneta and its young artistic director Daniel Lee were the big winners at the 2019 Fashion Awards on Monday, taking four awards in a star-studded ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London.</p>
<p>The Italian fashion house which specializes in high-end leather goods just last year named the 33-year-old Briton as creative director of the brand.</p>
<p>It was mission accomplished for the young Lee, with Bottega Veneta &#8211; founded in 1966 in Vicenza &#8211; named &#8220;brand of the year&#8221; at the annual British Fashion Council gathering.</p>
<p>And Lee, who worked at Margiela, Balenciaga and Donna Karan before taking over management of Celine&#8217;s ready-to-wear collections for five years, was crowned &#8220;designer of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was also named &#8220;British designer of the year, womenswear&#8221; and took the award for best accessories designer.</p>
<p>It was validation for the previously little-known designer, who confided that: &#8220;As a child, I often felt like an outsider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbadian superstar Rihanna received the &#8220;urban luxe&#8221; award from fellow singer Janet Jackson for her young label Fenty, part of the LVMH galaxy.</p>
<p>Adut Akech, 19 and originally from South Sudan, was named model of the year.</p>
<p>Alexander McQueen&#8217;s artistic director Sarah Burton, who joined the house in 1996, was also recognized for her visionary spirit with the &#8220;trailblazer award.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evening also recognized stars such as well-known supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was named &#8220;fashion icon,&#8221; while industry legend Giorgio Armani received the &#8220;outstanding achievement&#8221; award from Hollywood star Julia Roberts.</p>
<p>Vogue editor-in-chief and high priestess of fashion Anna Wintour paid a special tribute to her friend Karl Lagerfeld, who died in February.</p>
<p>Scottish fashion designer Christopher Kane took the designers&#8217; designer award.</p>

<p>US microblogging and social networking website Tumblr just released its 2019 review report on the K-pop industry. Boy band BTS topped the chart for &#8220;most talked-about&#8221; idol group, while its seven members claimed the first seven spots on the K-pop stars chart, starting with Jeon Jung-kook at No.1 for his second year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the third time that BTS has topped the Tumblr charts. The site generates the results through its &#8220;Fandometrics&#8221; calculations, which compiles tag data and posts about K-pop stars and groups on its website to understand how much they are talked about.</p>
<p>The news of BTS&#8217;s feat quickly spread to China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Members of the Chinese ARMY (the name for BTS fans) took to social media to express their excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;That is BTS! Every member is on the chart!&#8221; wrote netizen Youyu on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>Renowned Latvian maestro Mariss Jansons, who conducted some of the world&#8217;s most prestigious orchestras, has died at his home in Saint Petersburg, Russian authorities said on Sunday. He was 76.</p>
<p>Jansons, who had suffered from heart problems, died of cardiac arrest, according to people close to his family quoted by Russian media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sincere gratitude for his great art will always remain with us,&#8221; Saint Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov said in a statement, calling him &#8220;an outstanding conductor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considered one of the leading conductors to emerge from the former Soviet Union, Jansons was born in the Latvian capital Riga in 1943, the son of the renowned conductor Arvid Jansons, who died in 1984.</p>
<p>The family moved to Leningrad, the present-day Saint Petersburg, in 1956, where he studied violin, piano and conducting at the conservatory.</p>
<p>Jansons also studied under world-famous conductors Herbert von Karajan and Yevgeny Mravinsky.</p>
<p>He had directed the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra since 2003 after leading other well-known ensembles such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>A highly valued guest conductor, he collaborated with almost every major orchestra in the world in recent years.</p>
<p>He was also a part of the very exclusive club which conducted the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra for the New Year&#8217;s concert, chosen by the musicians themselves, in 2006, 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;We received the sad and shocking news of the death of Mariss Jansons this morning,&#8221; the Vienna Philharmonic said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Saks Fifth Avenue unveils <em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> dioramas for its annual holiday windows in New York on November 25. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Disney blockbuster<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> held top spot at the North American box office over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, taking in an estimated $85.2 million, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Sunday.</p>
<p>The animation adventure movie follows the beloved characters from 2013 hit<br />
<em>Frozen</em> as they travel to an ancient, autumn-bound forest in search of the origin of the magical ice powers of Queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel).</p>
<p><em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, which came out just in time for the winter holidays, secured $123.7 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday period from Wednesday to Sunday.</p>
<p>It was a Thanksgiving record, beating<br />
<em>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</em> in 2013, according to Variety.</p>
<p><em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> had pulled in a three-day total of $130.2 million the previous weekend when it was a new release &#8211; the third-best start for an animated film behind fellow Disney titles<br />
<em>Incredibles 2</em> (2018) and<br />
<em>Finding Dory</em> (2016).</p>
<p><em>Knives Out</em>, a murder mystery from Lionsgate starring Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis and Chris Evans, made a surprise $27 million for the Friday-to-Sunday period, and has been immediately hailed as a triumph for its original content at multiplexes.</p>
<p><em>Ford v Ferrari</em> slipped to third place with $13.2 million. The Fox film is based on the true story of how a team at Ford built a car to challenge Ferrari&#8217;s longtime dominance of France&#8217;s classic 24-hour Le Mans race.</p>
<p>Sony release<br />
<em>A Beautiful Day</em><br />
<em>in the Neighborhood</em>, a drama about a journalist&#8217;s relationship with beloved television star Fred Rogers (played by Tom Hanks), took fourth place with $11.8 million.</p>
<p>New Universal release<br />
<em>Queen and Slim</em>, a romantic drama starring Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith, also performed above expectations to earn fifth spot with $11.7 million.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top 10 were:</p>
<p><em>21 Bridges</em> ($5.8 million)</p>
<p><em>Playing with Fire</em> ($4.2 million)</p>
<p><em>Midway</em> ($3.9 million)</p>
<p><em>Joker</em> ($2 million)</p>
<p><em>Last <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a></em> ($1.9 million)</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Two people dressed as <em>Sesame Street</em> character Elmo, along with a man dressed as Batman, greet people on 42nd Street in New York on November 4. Photo: AFP</p>
<p>Beneath flashing billboards and sparkling skyscrapers, Maria Bega moves through Times Square&#8217;s pulsating crowds, dressed as Princess Anna from animated Disney movie<br />
<em>Frozen</em>.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Peruvian is one of dozens of men and women, mostly from Latin America, trying to eke out a living as costumed characters inside New York&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
<p>Dressed as<br />
<em>Sesame Street</em> fuzzballs Elmo and Cookie Monster and superheroes like Batman and Hulk, they pose for photos with tourists in exchange for tips, vying with topless women in body paint and a semi-naked guitar-playing cowboy.</p>
<p>For many visitors, the mascots are part of the frenetic entertainment district&#8217;s charm but to some New Yorkers they symbolize a crowded neon nightmare that is best avoided.</p>
<p>The characters are currently the subject of many complaints, proof of how much the area once known for peep shows, pornos and crack cocaine has been cleaned up in recent decades.</p>
<p>With its bright lights and giant branded stores, the famous intersection is a symbol of the city that never sleeps and its untold opportunities. Where dreams are made of, as the Alicia Keys and Jay-Z song goes.</p>
<p>But for Bega the reality is more of a nightmare. She says she sometimes makes just $20 a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come here to waste your time, to freeze to death, and sometimes you don&#8217;t even earn enough to eat,&#8221; Bega tells AFP in Spanish, her blue costume complete with ginger pigtails.</p>
<p>Bega got into the work through a friend and has colleagues from Mexico, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Many bring their costumes from their home countries, where they can be purchased fairly cheaply, or buy them online in the US where they commonly cost upwards of $200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They require no permit to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Naked</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Some are a little pushy but most of them are nice. They&#8217;re out here making a living like everybody else,&#8221; says 62-year-old Kentucky resident Dave Duke, who took a photo of his wife with a costumed Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>The entertainers say making money has become more difficult following several harassment and groping allegations that sparked articles in local tabloids about &#8220;costumed creeps.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, a man in an Elmo costume was arrested after being accused of groping the buttocks of a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of this the police came to bother us. They&#8217;re hardly letting us work,&#8221; says Bega, who does a second job in the evenings in order to care for her kids aged 2 and 10.</p>
<p>Jose from Mexico, a different &#8220;Elmo&#8221; to the one arrested, says one or two of the hucksters are spoiling it for everyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children used to run to me but now they see headlines about Elmo being a child molester and they don&#8217;t,&#8221; he explains, declining to give his surname.</p>
<p>Nearby, Robert Burck is having a better time of it, belting out tunes on his guitar while wearing only underpants, a cowboy hat and cowboy boots.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old known as the &#8220;Naked Cowboy&#8221; has been a regular fixture in Times Square for 20 years and says he makes around $150,000 a year in tips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I absolutely love the fact that I&#8217;m working in a den of thieves,&#8221; he jokes to AFP, as CD sellers and ticket touts hustle with tourists.</p>
<p>Renamed Times Square from Longacre Square in 1904 after The New York Times newspaper moved its headquarters there, the area has had its problems over the years.</p>
<p>For chunks of the 20th century it was a hotbed of vice where illegal drugs and prostitution flourished and entertainment centered on pornographic theaters and sex shows.</p>
<p>The area, heavily policed like much of New York due to fears it could be a target of terror attacks, is much less seedy today.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Crazy&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Up to 450,000 people are estimated to cross Times Square every day but some New Yorkers try to find a way around it if they can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under discussions such as &#8220;Why do New Yorkers dislike Times Square?&#8221; on Quora, locals cite crowds, overpriced restaurants, stores selling tourist tat and the costumed characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Times Square Alliance, a nonprofit that supports local businesses, wants to improve the famous intersection further by reining in the mascots.</p>
<p>It dislikes their pack-like modus operandi where one puts an arm around an unwitting tourist before others rush over to be in the photo and demand money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Times Square is always a little bit crazy. It&#8217;s all about capitalism,&#8221; Alliance President Tim Tompkins tells AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what we&#8217;re objecting to here is that sometimes it&#8217;s not voluntary,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Since 2016 the characters&#8217; commercial activities have been restricted to specific zones but some roam outside the marked areas.</p>
<p>The Alliance believes better regulation of the costumed characters by city authorities would make Times Square even more family-friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make the experience the best for people who have the opportunity to visit here,&#8221; says Tompkins.</p>
<p>Times Square is nicknamed &#8220;The Crossroads of the World.&#8221; There, Bega finds that she is at a crossroads of her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work is not sustainable. I don&#8217;t know if I can continue like this,&#8221; she says, before running off to join her friend dressed as Winnie the Pooh.</p>

The framework of &#8220;Experience China&#8221;, a series of cultural events that have served as a platform to give foreign audiences access to Chinese culture, kicked off here on Monday. (Xinhua/Zhang Man)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />A training program dedicated to providing young Chinese dancers with career development platforms has trained 46 young artists, according to the China Dancers Association (CDA). </p>
<p>The training program focuses on cultivating and supporting young dancers by various means including offering vocational training, raising funds for art creation, as well as sponsoring performances, the CDA said. </p>
<p>Experts, scholars and artists both inside and outside the industry are invited to take the lead in art creation so as to develop a &#8220;demand-oriented&#8221; model. </p>
<p>Since the program was launched in 2014, a total of 55 original dance works have been presented on stage, touring 13 countries for more than 200 performances, many of which were awarded domestic and international prizes.</p>

<p>The upcoming latest episode of reality show<br />
<em>Encounter,</em> which will be made available on Tencent Video on Tuesday, will see Chinese musicians Aya, Tan Weiwei and Xiao He collect children&#8217;s folk songs in local dialects in Hangzhou and other neighboring areas in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passed down by word of mouth through the generations, children&#8217;s songs in local dialects are facing extinction due to rapid urbanization and social changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the show, the musicians seek out the original songs and then remake them&nbsp; to fit today&#8217;s modern times in order to remind people of the long-unheard voices of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second season of the show currently has a high rating of 7.6/10 on Chinese media review site Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s director Zhao Qi said that the second season, which kicked off on October 22, will &#8220;return to humanity itself.&#8221; The first season once raised questions about life and death, topics commonly discussed by many families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Russian cheeses on sale at a shop Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Elvira Kovtun made her first cheese in a pot in her kitchen four years ago.</p>
<p>Kovtun, a housewife and mostly self-taught cheesemaker, became so good that she and her husband decided to turn her passion into a business.</p>
<p>Last month, the high-school sweethearts and parents of three became the first Russians to win a gold prize at the World Cheese Awards, with their &#8220;Peshernyi&#8221; hard cheese taking the honor at the industry&#8217;s equivalent of the Oscars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think this was possible,&#8221; Elvira&#8217;s husband, Vyacheslav Kovtun, told AFP at their small creamery in the industrial town of Korolyov, outside Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I believe in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family&#8217;s success shows how far Russia&#8217;s cheese-making industry has come since President Vladimir Putin banned Western food imports in 2014 in a tit-for-tat measure over the<br />
<a href="http://backup.globaltimes.cn/SPECIALCOVERAGE/Ukrainecrisis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Many Russians had developed a taste for French and Italian cheeses prior to sanctions, and Moscow seized the opportunity to put in place an &#8220;import substitution&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>This supported local entrepreneurs trying to set up businesses to replace imported goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results were often mixed, however, with many customers complaining of the higher price and often inferior quality of the Russian-made products.</p>
<p>But dairy farming and cheese-making have become a bright spot.</p>
<p>According to Russia&#8217;s National Association of Milk Producers, production of cheese and cheese products grew by a third to 670,000 tons a year between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>Last week Putin confessed he was &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; when the first punitive measures were introduced, but the events of the past few years proved that the sanctions had worked to &#8220;our economy&#8217;s advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ground-breaking&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of artisanal creameries have cropped up across the country and some, like the Kovtuns, are winning top marks from international critics.</p>
<p>Elvira and Vyacheslav, who are both 40 and opened their Korolyov creamery in 2018, had not expected success to come so quickly.</p>
<p>When Elvira called her husband to break the news of the award last month, she was sobbing, Vyacheslav said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got scared. I thought something terrible had happened,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Their creamery&#8217;s website crashed from interest after the awards were announced and the winning cheese sold out until April 2020.</p>
<p>More than 3,800 cheeses from 42 countries were in competition at this year&#8217;s World Cheese Awards in Bergamo, Italy, where products are awarded with supergold, gold, silver or bronze prizes.</p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s competition no Russian entries were recognized but this year the Kovtuns&#8217; Cheese &amp; Beer creamery and three other Russian cheesemakers won a total of nine awards.</p>
<p>John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food which organizes the competition, said the Kovtuns had put Russia on the international cheese map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gold winners are some of the best in the world and only a small percentage of entries do this well,&#8221; Farrand said, praising their Peshernyi cheese for &#8220;delivering a true sense of terroir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Russia&#8217;s lack of the cheese-making heritage of France or Italy could in some ways be an advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free from the pressures of tradition, the country&#8217;s artisans can innovate and produce something ground-breaking and unique,&#8221; Farrand said in written comments to AFP.</p>
<p>Elvira said she spent several years perfecting Peshernyi and the recipe is a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Cheese fever&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>With its nutty and fruity hints, Peshernyi matures for seven months in a cellar and sells for 1,800 rubles ($28) a kilogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t last a day without cheese,&#8221; Elvira said, placing curd grains in moulds with the help of an assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all my babies. I love them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kovtuns now make 20 soft and hard varieties including camembert and truffle brie, employing a handful of staff.</p>
<p>They produce cheeses five days a week but demand far outstrips supply.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Barabanshchikov, a chef and connoisseur of European cheeses who traditionally shunned Russian-made dairy products, went to meet the Kovtuns as soon as he learned of their success in Bergamo.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is professional,&#8221; said Barabanshchikov, executive chef at Integrita, a top supplier of high-quality imported food.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very pleased for them because I know the cheese-making technology,&#8221; Barabanshchikov told AFP, stressing that hard cheeses require a lot of investment, expertise and good-quality milk.</p>
<p>One of the people who has most championed the Kovtuns is their competitor Oleg Sirota, arguably Russia&#8217;s best-known cheesemaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more good creameries we have, the more people will trust us,&#8221; said the 31-year-old head of the Union of Russian Cheesemakers.</p>
<p>He himself took his first gold at a regional competition in France in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sirota recalled how Vyacheslav, who owned a construction firm at the time, ambushed him at a gas station outside Moscow in 2016, saying he wanted to learn the business of cheese-making and was ready to sell his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was stunned,&#8221; Sirota said.</p>
<p>They now help each other, plan to expand their operations and praise Putin for creating what Sirota calls Russia&#8217;s &#8220;cheese fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vyacheslav said Russia&#8217;s modern cheesemakers are continuing a long tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not inventing anything new,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a lot of cheese a hundred years ago and exported it to Europe and the Baltics. We are now reviving our forefathers&#8217; recipes.&#8221;</p>

<p>K-pop powerhouse EXO&#8217;s sixth album<br />
<em>Obsession</em> was finally released at 5 pm on Wednesday, which was also band member Chanyeol&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>The hashtag &#8220;OBSESSEDwithEXO&#8221; topped the trending list on Twitter in many countries including Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand after the K-pop icons released a music video teaser and posters for the album at 11 am that same day.</p>
<p>Prior to the release, hundreds of thousands of Chinese netizens took to social media to express their anticipation for the upcoming album as well as wish Chanyeol a happy birthday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;EXO will always continue to stay on top due to their talent and hard work. They have gained so many prizes at different award ceremonies and will keep shinning on the stage all the time,&#8221; wrote one Chinese netizen on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monster Byun Baek-hyun really comes for all of our necks in the best possible way, and we love to see it,&#8221; another netizen commented on the platform.</p>
<p>The album is expected to be a global hit since it was produced by several well-known South Korean and international musicians including US musician and producer Dem Jointz, British production team LDN Noise, the Joombas music group and South Korean singer-songwriter and record producer Yoo Young-jin.</p>
