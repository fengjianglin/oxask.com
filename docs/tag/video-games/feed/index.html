<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Google&#8217;s Stadia controller Photo: IC</p>
<p>Google set out to transform the video game world Tuesday with the launch of a service called Stadia that is crafted to let people access console-quality games as easily as they do email.</p>
<p>Within moments of Google flipping the switch to turn on the Stadia platform, gamers began firing off complaints ranging from sluggish play action to not receiving kits or access codes.</p>
<p>Some gamers, notoriously protective of their world, lashed out at the very notion of disrupting the reliance on consoles or personal computers with a service that hosts titles in the cloud and promises access on smartphones, tablets and more.</p>
<p>An MBG channel at YouTube that spotlights PlayStation consoles tweeted that Stadia was flopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t smiling,&#8221; MBG said in the tweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s cynical but I can&#8217;t support a company who is pushing for a cloud only gaming future. Stadia simply can&#8217;t compete with PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo or PC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stadia critics also questioned the value of paying a monthly subscription to the service, only to have to buy games if they want to play titles other than the few available with memberships.</p>
<p>Google is aiming for a piece of a global video game industry expected to top $150 billion this year by using its cloud computing technology offering rich features without the need for consoles.</p>
<p>Google last month sold out of &#8220;Founder&#8217;s Edition&#8221; kits, which are priced at $129. Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.</p>
<p>Stadia games are also playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers and with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward.</p>
<p>Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the US, will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Subscribers are able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data centers, but some free games will be available to them, starting with Destiny 2: The Collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stadia on smartphones, at the start, works with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services.</p>
<p>Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winning is everything to gamers and if networks aren&#8217;t able to support immersive and interactive experiences then the next revolution in cloud gaming won&#8217;t get past the loading screen,&#8221; said Steve Alexander, chief technology officer at networking systems specialty company Ciena.</p>
<p>&#8220;The success of cloud gaming depends heavily on the underlying network and how much controlled-latency traffic it can support during periods of peak demand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Google appeared to be committed to making Stadia a success, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early.</p>
<p>The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.</p>
<p>Early expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn&#8217;t the end of the world,&#8221; he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.</p>
<p>US technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform that it plans to make available on Windows-powered personal computers next year.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has a PlayStation Now service that combines cloud gaming and title downloads that is synched to its latest-generation consoles and Windows personal computers.</p>
<p>Having titles sit on powerful servers in the cloud could allow for unprecedented features such as thousands of people playing simultaneously or environments as detailed as the real world.</p>
<p>The Google move follows the launch of the Apple Arcade mobile game service, which offers custom game apps downloaded to devices. A rival Google Play Pass charges the same $4.99 monthly subscription price as that of Arcade, which focuses on games for Apple iOS devices.</p>

<p>&#8220;The 29-year-old Kris Wu wishes to warm your inner heart with my most sincere feelings,&#8221; Wu wrote on Sina Weibo at 00:06 am on Wednesday in a post announcing the song. The post has been reposted 11,849 times and liked 64,396 times as of Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<em>Eternal Love</em> has earned 340 million views on Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>Written and produced by Wu, the single, which features a notable classic and ancient Chinese style is expected to become a hit. The comments section of his Sina Weibo account was immediately flooded with thousands of supportive and excited comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lyrics of the song are very heart-warming. Everyone will recall the ups and downs they&#8217;ve experienced in their lives,&#8221; Xu Yike, a 20-year-old fan, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to his singing career, Wu is also actively engaged in acting. The star is set to appear along with Chinese actress Yang Zi in the Chinese TV drama<br />
<em>The Golden Hairpin</em>, which is based on the popular historical fiction novel<br />
<em>Memoirs of the Golden Hairpin</em>, according to a report from ifeng.com on October 30.</p>
