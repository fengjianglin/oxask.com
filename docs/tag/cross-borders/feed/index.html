<p>US President Donald Trump launched a two-day NATO meeting Tuesday with a blistering attack on France&#8217;s criticism of the alliance and on &#8220;delinquent&#8221; members that don&#8217;t pay their way.</p>
<p>At a news conference held to celebrate NATO&#8217;s success in cajoling European allies to boost their defense spending, Trump could not resist lashing out at French President<br />
 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a>.</p>
<p>Macron had tried to shake up the agenda for the London summit by branding the 70-year-old Western alliance &#8220;brain-dead,&#8221; but Trump slapped him down and warned that he could see Paris &#8220;breaking away&#8221; from NATO.</p>
<p>&#8220;NATO serves a great purpose,&#8221; Trump said, at a joint press appearance with alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s very insulting,&#8221; he said of Macron&#8217;s comment, branding it a &#8220;very, very nasty statement essentially to 28 countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody needs NATO more than France,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very dangerous statement for them to make.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asked whether the US alliance with NATO was shaky, Trump denied it, but said, &#8220;I do see France breaking off&#8230; I see him breaking off.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Macron comments set an angry tone for the meeting, there are also expected to be clashes with Turkey&#8217;s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was also furious with the French leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, have your own brain death checked. These statements are suitable only to people like you who are in a state of brain death,&#8221; he said last week.</p>
<p>French officials summoned the Turkish envoy in Paris to complain while a US administration official predicted that many members would tackle Turkey over its purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system.</p>
<p>Turkey, in turn, has warned it will block a NATO plan to defend Baltic countries unless the alliance recognizes a Kurdish militant group as terrorists, Erdogan said before the summit.</p>
<p>It was reported last week that Ankara was blocking NATO&#8217;s new Baltic defense plan, demanding greater support in its fight against the Syrian Kurdish People&#8217;s Protection Units.</p>
<p>NATO has mooted a plan to bolster the defenses of Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia against a potential attack from Russia, though details remain unclear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a &#8220;slide back&#8221; in global efforts to eliminate measles on Tuesday, as the death toll from an outbreak that has killed dozens of children in Samoa continued to climb.</p>
<p>A total of 55 people have died since the epidemic began in mid-October, 50 of them children aged 4 or under, officials in the Pacific nation said Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another 18 infants are critically ill in hospital and the crisis shows no sign of slowing, with 153 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking the national total to 3,881 in a population of 200,000.</p>
<p>WHO medical officer for the western Pacific, Jose Hagan, said it was a grim reminder of the danger posed by &#8220;probably the most infectious disease that we know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately the case [to] fatality rate of measles is much higher than people realize,&#8221; he told Radio New Zealand. &#8220;This is quite a severe disease and we just aren&#8217;t used to seeing it, so it comes as quite a surprise when we see how fatal it can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hagen said increased access to measles vaccines was estimated to have saved 21 million lives over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are starting to have a slide back and there are outbreaks happening all over the world in all WHO regions and it&#8217;s leading to the virus being exported through international travel,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cases have skyrocketed in Europe, leading to Britain, Greece, the Czech Republic and Albania all losing their measles-free status in August.</p>
<p>The US narrowly maintained its &#8220;measles eliminated&#8221; status a few months later, despite experiencing its worst outbreak since 1992.</p>

<br />Veteran Argentine diplomat Rafael Grossi was sworn in on Monday as the new director general of the UN&#8217;s nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the growing crisis over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program at the top of his in-tray.</p>
<p>Grossi had been serving as Argentina&#8217;s ambassador to the IAEA and is the agency&#8217;s first leader from Latin America. He previously held high-level posts at the agency between 2010 and 2013, bringing him into contact with Iranian officials at a time when international negotiations over Iran&#8217;s nuclear activities were intensifying.</p>
<p>Grossi took over from ­Yukiya Amano, who died in July at the age of 72 having been in post since 2009.</p>
<p>Grossi began his tenure amid a growing crisis over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>The IAEA is charged with monitoring the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which seems in danger of imminent collapse.</p>
<p>Without mentioning Iran by name, in his first speech to IAEA member states on Monday, Grossi praised the agency&#8217;s &#8220;impartial, accurate system of inspections.&#8221; &#8220;No one else can do what we can do, no one else can provide this credible assurance that nobody is diverting nuclear material&nbsp; to make nuclear weapons,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diplomats from Iran and the other remaining parties to the deal &#8211; the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia &#8211; will gather in Vienna on Friday to discuss ways forward for the crumbling deal.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during the wrapping-up press conference of a two-day NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) defense ministers&#8217; meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 25, 2019. (Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The US is to cut its contribution to NATO&#8217;s operating budget, officials said on Thursday, with Germany increasing payments as the alliance tries to appease US President Donald Trump ahead of a summit next week.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly ­criticized European members for freeloading on the US, singling out Germany for lagging behind on an alliance commitment to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.</p>
<p>While most of Trump&#8217;s anger has been focused on European national defense budgets, there has also been US grumbling about how much Washington contributes to NATO&#8217;s own running costs, and the 29-member alliance has now agreed to a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the new formula, cost shares attributed to most European allies and Canada will go up, while the US share will come down,&#8221; a NATO official said.</p>
<p>The US currently pays 22.1 percent of the NATO budget &#8211; which totaled $2.5 billion in 2019 &#8211; and Germany 14.8 percent, under a formula based on each country&#8217;s gross national income. Under the new agreement, the US will cut its contribution to 16.35 percent of the total, Germany&#8217;s will rise to the same level and other allies will pay more.</p>
<p>Though the sums involved are small in military terms &#8211; the 29 alliance members spent a total of nearly $1 trillion on defense in 2018 &#8211; not all allies are happy with the move.</p>
<p>Diplomats say France has refused to go along with the new arrangement and will keep its contribution the same at 10.5 percent, arguing that the deal to change the figures was cooked up between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel without properly consulting other allies.</p>
