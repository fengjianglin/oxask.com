U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors monitored the latest development of trade issues between the United States and its major trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 280.23 points, or 1.01 percent, to 27,502.81. The S&amp;P 500 fell 20.67 points, or 0.66 percent, to 3,093.20.

<br />US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors monitored the latest development of trade issues between the United States and its major trading partners.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 280.23 points, or 1.01 percent, to 27,502.81. The S&amp;P 500 fell 20.67 points, or 0.66 percent, to 3,093.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 47.34 points, or 0.55 percent, to 8,520.64.</p>
<p>Most of the 30 Dow components traded in red territory, with Intel and Dow declining 2.76 percent and 2.52 percent, respectively, leading the laggards.</p>
<p>Nine of the 11 primary S&amp;P 500 sectors traded on a downbeat note, with the energy sector losing 1.55 percent, the biggest loser.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will &#8220;restore&#8221; tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Brazil and Argentina, drawing wide concern domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>Calling the move &#8220;unexpected,&#8221; Argentine Minister of Production and Labor Dante Sica said &#8220;we still don&#8217;t know what this implies. We want to know the details and the scope of the announcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brazil Steel Institute, which represents the interests of steel exporters, said in a statement that the new tariffs would hurt not only Brazilian companies, but also U.S. steel companies, as they would need the semi-finished products imported from Brazil.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s threat to hit French products with tariffs over a taxation dispute concerning large U.S. tech companies also fueled turmoil in the stock market.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A sale sign stands out side a store in the Central district of Hong Kong Photo: VCG</p>
<p>After the US enacted two laws that could be potentially punishing for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy, there is no clear sign that its close allies &#8211; including the UK, Canada, Germany and Australia &#8211; will follow suit immediately, despite rising calls for them to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these countries, the decision presents a huge dilemma as they consider their massive economic interests in the global finance and commerce hub and the potentially damaging countermeasures any such attempt could prompt from Beijing, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a fact that these Western countries cannot ignore: &#8220;Sanctioning Hong Kong is looking for trouble,&#8221; Liang Haiming, a Hong Kong-based economist, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Take the EU as an example. Hong Kong was the bloc&#8217;s 20th largest trading partner in 2018 and its eighth-largest partner in Asia, with a total trade volume reaching 46.5 billion euros ($51.5 billion), according to EU data. Additionally, the EU has over 2,200 companies operating in the city.</p>
<p>Germany, Australia and Canada also have huge economic interests in Hong Kong, which serves as a hub for trade in and out of the Chinese mainland. In 2018, trade between Hong Kong and Germany reached 14.12 billion euros, while trade between Hong Kong and Australia stood at $6.9 billion, according to official Hong Kong data. Trade between Canada and Hong Kong reached $3.76 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>Though officials in Germany, the UK, Australia and Canada have long sided with the radical protesters in Hong Kong, thus far they have not publicly announced any concrete actions to follow the US&#8217; suit, despite rising domestic calls for them to do so.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, Foreign Office ministers have threatened to use sanctions laws against individuals in Hong Kong that they deem guilty of human rights abuses, the Guardian reported on November 13. In Canada, there are also calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to adopt US-style laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything, these countries &#8220;should be chastising the US for hurting their interests,&#8221; Liang said, noting that the US move is &#8220;an unjust cause that lacks popular support.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the two new US laws requires the US government, specifically the US State Department, to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong&#8217;s human rights and democracy status, which could then lead to a change in its special trade arrangement with the US. The move has drawn fury from officials in Beijing, who called it blatant interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs and a punishment for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>China on Monday announced countermeasures against the US&#8217; move, including the suspension of US warship and aircraft visits to the city and the sanctioning of multiple US-based non-governmental organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its allies follow in the US&#8217; footsteps, they will &#8220;also face the ire of China&#8217;s central government,&#8221; Liang said.</p>

<p>While black-clad protesters in Hong Kong waved American flags and chanted &#8220;President Donald Trump, let&#8217;s make Hong Kong great again,&#8221; the city has been plunging into its deepest recession in a decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said on Tuesday that officials would soon roll out a fourth round of relief measures as the city now faces a &#8220;severe economic situation.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She revealed that unemployment was expected to further rise from the current 3.1 percent.</p>
<p>The city recorded its biggest retail slump in October, a drop of 24.3 percent year-on-year, and the HKSAR government is poised to experience the first budget deficit in 15 years in the fiscal year that ends in March 2020.Some raised questions about whether protesters expect a recession, and several prominent economists predicted that Asia&#8217;s financial hub is quite likely to see an economic contraction in 2020, which will take a toll on financial market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s economy is expected to contract 1.3 percent year-on-year in 2019 due to external pressure and social unrest, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po told the Panel on Financial Affairs of Legislative Council on Monday. A sharp economic deterioration and recession, in addition to months of violence, has weakened investment confidence, affected local consumption and will further weigh on people&#8217;s livelihoods, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tension returned to Hong Kong&#8217;s streets during the weekend as clashes between rioters and police broke out in different districts such as Mong Kok and Whampoa. Rioters trashed stores and beat up innocent residents who disagreed with their behavior. There were major clashes barely after a week-long &#8220;truce,&#8221; especially during the District Council election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some local residents and tourists from the Chinese mainland said they are still worried about their personal safety when they walk the streets and local businesses, which have been suffering amid months of social unrest, see a dim future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest figures from the Hong Kong Tourism Board showed that visitor arrivals dropped 43.7 percent year-on-year in October, casting a shadow over industries including retail, services, restaurants, hotels and so on. It was the sharpest drop in a single month since an outbreak of SARS in 2003, and it has turned some tourist sites like Disneyland into &#8220;ghost towns,&#8221; according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong economists worried that months of protests would have long-term consequences on the local economy. The city has also been hit by the China-US trade war because of its role as a major a trading hub. When asked whether Hong Kong risks losing its advantages as a global business and trade window, Francis T. Lui, professor emeritus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, noted that many illegal acts occurred amid political and social unrest and this weighed heavily on Hong Kong&#8217;s business reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A major reason the city became an international business hub was its stable social order and respect for the rule of law, the spirit of contract that business values the most,&#8221; Lui told the Global Times, raising questions about whether the city could maintain those advantages.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Graphics: GT</p>
<p><strong>Financial woes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although anti-government protests have lasted for nearly six months, investors retained confidence in Hong Kong financial markets, which have not become casualties amid the trade war and social unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mainland&#8217;s internet giant Alibaba held an IPO on the Asian region&#8217;s largest financial market, a strong endorsement of the city&#8217;s unshakeable role as global financial hub and the mainland&#8217;s gateway to the global markets, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul Chan said in a blog post on Sunday that though social unrest has hit the local economy hard and seriously affected livelihoods, its consequences on Hong Kong&#8217;s financial market are still limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The financial market has been operating smoothly and orderly,&#8221; Chan said, noting that the Hong Kong stock market entered a new phase of development following Alibaba&#8217;s listing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if violence and chaos continue, the financial market will also be hurt, as the city would lose its attractiveness to both talent and investors, according to analysts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As protests raged in recent weeks, some financial firms urged employees to work at home, as their offices are located in places like Central where regular illegal gatherings were held from time to time. Some banks also shut branches to avoid collateral damage following clashes between police and protests that usually turned violent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the workers in the financial hub, some are expats and mainland employees, and some are considering moving away. Prolonged disruptions to work and daily life also pushed more Hong Kong workers in the sector to think about the possibility of moving abroad, Bloomberg reported in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the near future, financial talent won&#8217;t consider working here in Hong Kong, while more foreign businesses will move away and investment will continue declining. Whether the city could maintain the global financial status, that&#8217;s indeed a worry,&#8221; Chan Kin-por, the chairman of the Legislative Council (LegCo)&#8217;s Finance Committee, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Hong Kong declines, mainland cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen have been accelerating the development of their financial services, which would also narrow the distance between them and Hong Kong,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deep-rooted issues</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observers said that tackling the city&#8217;s economic woes should be preceded by handling social issues such as legislative reform, providing more opportunities for Hong Kong youth and resolving deep-rooted land supply problems, observers said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-03/15682c7c-c3c2-4297-b63b-ebce3464fba8.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Graphics: GT</p>
<p>Considering the city&#8217;s lack of effectiveness in handling riots, Lui suggested that Article 18 of the Basic Law could be an option to end riots and chaos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress decides to declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the HKSAR, which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the HKSAR government, the central government may order the application of relevant national laws in the city, according to the article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young people in a highly politicized society may pay less attention to their own development, as a major focus in the recent District Council election shifted from improving livelihoods to supporting the political agenda of opposition groups. &#8220;Only when deep-rooted issues are handled, will Hong Kong people shift their focus again to an economic recovery,&#8221; LegCo&#8217;s Chan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some local residents who are considering moving out of the city amid social turmoil, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area could offer new opportunities to start businesses, find jobs, find schools for their children and so on. &#8220;This is likely to be a chance for further integration in the area too,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<p>Foreign investors have been reinforcing their purchasing power on Chinese bonds, official data showed. Analysts give credit to the reform and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market, and&nbsp;bigger interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investors jumped at Chinese bonds in the first 11 months of the year, with cumulative net purchases reaching 970.2 billion yuan ($137.77 billion), data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) showed on Monday. That meant the total cumulative net purchases from foreign investors have approached nearly 1 trillion yuan in the first 11 months.</p>
<p>In November, transactions by foreign investors came to a total of 567 billion yuan, up 5 percent month-on-month and 127 percent year-on-year, CFETS said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November was the 12th consecutive month that foreign investors snapped up Chinese bonds. It is also notable that the number of foreign investors new to China&#8217;s interbank bonds market in the first 11 months &#8211; 1,331 &#8211; has surpassed the total number in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market have enabled more foreign investors to enter China&#8217;s financial market, as reflected by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and the country&#8217;s great efforts to build the yuan&#8217;s offshore financial market, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the risk of investing overseas is increasing with a declining yield rate under the pressure of the global economic downturn … but China&#8217;s bonds have relatively good returns on investment,&#8221; Liu noted, adding that foreigners&#8217; increasing purchasing power shows their confidence in China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 marks the lowest-performing year for global bond yields, but the interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds have surged to an historical peak, the China Securities Journal reported on Tuesday. Statistics showed the 10-year bond spreads between China and the US have surpassed 140 basis points, which is relatively high historically, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Gree&#8217;s stock price closed high on Monday morning at 59.96 yuan ($8.65), after Gree said it will be without a controlling shareholder as the private equity firm Hillhouse Capital becomes the biggest shareholder of Gree Electric on Monday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Hillhouse Capital will take over 15 percent of Gree&#8217;s shares at a price of 41.6 billion yuan ($5.9 billion).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">As Hillhouse Capital takes over Gree&#8217;s shares, the company is now without an actual controlling shareholder and left with a new management system, which is deemed as a modern shareholding system. Numerous companies are under such a system, including Pingan and TCL, according to a report by yicai.com </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Market participants generally believe that with such a large quantity of investment, the cash flow will lead to higher dividend requirements from major shareholders. It is expected that Gree&#8217;s dividend rate will increase in the future, the report said. </span></p>

<p>China&#8217;s economy, second-ranked globally in nominal GDP terms and the largest based on an adjustment of GDP for purchasing power parity (PPP), will remain among the best performers in the global economic landscape in the upcoming year, China market watchers said.</p>
<p>Whether the economy can maintain 6 percent growth or not, it&#8217;s poised to retain its leading position and continue to serve as the locomotive of the global economy, they noted.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are expected to be seen in both domestic and overseas markets in 2020, Guo Xiaobei, a researcher with China Minsheng Bank, told the Global Times, estimating the Chinese economy will post full-year expansion of around 6 percent in the next year.</p>
<p>Guo cited China&#8217;s implementation of various reform measures such as the ramped-up opening of the economy at an accelerated pace, monetary easing by major economies, hopes for a thaw in China-US trade tensions, and the UK&#8217;s effort to block a no-deal<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a>.</p>
<p>That suggests China will continue to power up the global economy, and the feat won&#8217;t be challenged by the possible scenario of growth falling below 6 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>According to data from the World Bank, China&#8217;s GDP in current US-dollar terms totaled $13.61 trillion in 2018, second only to the US with $20.49 trillion. Japan held the third spot with $4.97 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going by GDP in PPP terms, China was already the largest economy with $25.36 trillion last year, followed by the US with $20.49 trillion and India with $10.50 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation also excelled as measured by annualized growth rates. India was the fastest-growing major economy with 6.98 percent expansion in 2018, ahead of China with 6.6 percent growth. The US economy was in third place with 2.86 percent growth, according to World Bank statistics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With US growth expected to moderate in 2020 and India still struggling to recover from the shock of its economy slumping to a more-than-six-year low of 4.5 percent in the July-September period from 7 percent a year earlier, the estimates that China will remain the power of the global economy seem to hold up well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has topped the global rankings of contributions to global economic growth since 2006, according to a report released in August by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>

<p>Though China has witnessed slow economic growth amid the China-US trade war, it has stabilized its job market thanks to the country&#8217;s tertiary industries, which have created more positions during the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading efforts.</p>
<p>The country&#8217; s steady employment situation refutes claims by US President Donald Trump that China had lost 3 million jobs due to the trade war. Experts gave credit to the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading and the appearance of new forms of flexible employment, saying the stable job market shows the resilience of China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies in tertiary sectors told the Global Times that they had created millions of new job opportunities over recent years, and they have great demand for professional talent in IT, procurement, operations and services to support development in the future.</p>
<p>Industry reports showed that live-streaming, a new industry rising amid the fast development of the country&#8217;s internet sector, has generated a total of 4 million new jobs for the country; the food delivery industry has generated over 20 million job opportunities in both direct and indirect forms &#8211; some of which haven&#8217;t yet been factored into the official National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the downward pressure on the economy, one of the main factors necessary to maintaining the stable job market is the function of tertiary industries as a reservoir of employment,&#8221; said NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong, noting that tertiary industries cover a broad spectrum, with a growing number of enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 55 percent of employed people worked in tertiary industries in China, NBS said on November 20.</p>
<p>More and more Chinese graduates hope to work in tertiary industries, in companies such as those working with cutting-edge technology or the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>23-year-old postgraduate student Zhang Yali is looking for a job in the internet industry in Beijing. Majoring in journalism and communications, she would prefer a product-operations or user-operations position in an internet company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having commenced her job hunt in August, Zhang has applied for eight jobs in large Chinese internet companies such as tech conglomerate Tencent and ride-hailing services provider Didi Chuxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Chinese internet companies had mass layoffs at the end of last year, I still want to enter this industry because it is a driving force for economic development and working in this industry will be promising,&#8221; Zhang said. She knows the work will be challenging and require staying up late, but the industry will enable her to catch up with the pace of China&#8217;s economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of the year, China created 11.93 million new urban jobs across the country, meeting 2019&#8217;s annual target of more than 11 million new urban jobs in advance of the deadline. The unemployment rate in urban areas dropped 0.1 percentage points to 5.1 percent in October, mainly due to the improving employment status of graduates, NBS said.</p>
<p>Li Chang&#8217;an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that the improving employment absorption capacity in the services industry had effectively resolved employment difficulties in secondary industries.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p><i>All eyes are on the possibility of China&#8217;s GDP growth falling below 6 percent in 2020. What if China&#8217;s GDP growth falls below 6 percent in 2020, as the prolonged China-US trade war and a slowing global economy continue to cast a shadow on the country&#8217;s economic growth? Leading Chinese economists and China market watchers are unfazed by concerns over whether or not the world&#8217;s second-largest economy can hold the psychological 6 percent growth level, showed a new poll from the Global Times released on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roughly half of the respondents of a GT Source poll of 22 leading Chinese economists and China market watchers opted for a greater than 50 percent chance of the economy growing at a pace of below 6 percent in the next year. The other half chose the other side of the China growth coin &#8211; the probability of below-6-percent growth would be less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Among the poll respondents were Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits; Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC; Hong Hao, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International; Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE); Sheng Songcheng, former head of the statistics and analysis department of the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC), China&#8217;s central bank; and Yao Yang, dean of the National School of Development of Peking University.</i></p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy faces pressure to maintain 6 percent growth in 2020, but optimism about the economy prevails among leading Chinese economists and China market watchers. They&#8217;re unfazed by concerns over whether the world&#8217;s second-largest economy can hold the key level of support or not, the findings of a new poll from the Global Times showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The survey results indicated that views are about evenly split when it comes to maintaining 6-percent GDP growth or embracing a sub-6 percent growth rate.</p>
<p>The poll included respondents from leading Chinese and foreign banks, government-affiliated think tanks, private research institutes and venture capital firms, giving a valuable look inside the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a high probability that [the economy will grow at a pace] of 6 percent or above,&#8221; Zhang at CCIEE said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chance of the economy slipping below 6 percent would be less than 50 percent, according to Sheng, a former PBC official and currently adjunct professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School. He said that the economy is heading for a rebound next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy expanded by 6 percent in the third quarter of 2019, the weakest quarterly figure since 1992 when official records began, official data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Dong Ximiao, chief analyst at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute, put it, the Chinese economy has bottomed out, meaning &#8220;there&#8217;s no room left for economic indicators to move further down, and there are already signs of marginal improvements in the economy.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those choosing the other side of the coin, instead of voicing pessimism, have favored a market-oriented growth trajectory that may sometimes fluctuate widely, over an obsession with pushing growth into a 6-percent range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting the odds of falling below 6 percent at 80 percent, Hong at BOCOM International said that the structure of the economy has changed with the services sector contributing massively to economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />

<p>Taking GDP numbers to heart is reminiscent of the past when Chinese people lived in a planned economy, he told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The planned economy was shown to be dwelling on whether we managed to grow the economy by a certain percentage so as to reach a certain economic size,&#8221; Hong said, noting that such a mindset goes against market orientation as it risks leading to a substantial resource misallocation.</p>
<p>A numerical approach to economic policymaking ought to be abandoned, argued the head of research at BOCOM International, who forecast that sub-6 percent growth would be normal in years to come.</p>
<p>In a research note sent to the Global Times in late November, Goldman Sachs economists led by Andrew Tilton expected China&#8217;s economic growth in 2020 to be marginally lower at 5.8 percent compared with 6.1 percent estimated for the whole of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Tao, chief China economist of UBS, predicted in a note sent to the Global Times in mid-November that China&#8217;s GDP growth would stabilize at 5.7 percent in 2020 and 5.6 percent in 2021.</p>
<p>Jing Linbo, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Evaluation Studies, one of the poll respondents voting for a greater than 50 percent chance, said &#8220;it&#8217;s already quite difficult for China&#8217;s economy, of such a gigantic size, to maintain a growth rate of above 6 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the economy shifting toward more balanced growth, a slowdown in GDP expansion is a well-accepted scenario, Jing commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the words of Hong, slower growth hasn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t become a source of concern.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s transition away from a labor-intensive growth model and toward its thriving internet sector has created a multitude of non-traditional jobs such as individual vendors on Taobao that have yet to be included in the official job market survey, he stressed. Every percentage of China&#8217;s GDP growth now creates many more jobs than was the case previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another sign of the economy&#8217;s resilience, the Chinese mainland equity market has posted an impressive performance for the whole of the year, remarked Hong, also chief strategist at BOCOM International.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.13 percent at 2,875.81 points on Monday. The flagship index had risen by 15.31 percent as of Monday since the beginning of the year.&nbsp;</p>
