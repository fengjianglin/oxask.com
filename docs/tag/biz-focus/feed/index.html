<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China&#8217;s ride-hailing giant DiDi kicked off operations in 13 more Chilean cities on Tuesday, bringing the total to 23.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s expansion means the service is available from north to south, with five northern cities of Arica, Iquique, Calama, Copiapo and Ovalle and seven southern cities of Curico, Chillan, Los Angeles, Valdivia, Osorno, Coyhaique and Punta Arenas, as well as the central city of Los Andes, now within DiDi&#8217;s sphere of operations.</p>
<p>DiDi&#8217;s ride-sharing and taxi services have been well-received in the South American country, enabling the company&#8217;s rapid expansion, said Simeng Wang, general manager of DiDi Chile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very thankful for the support and reception we have had since the starting in Chile,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, without a doubt, DiDi&#8217;s commitment is to deliver a better service at a more convenient price, so everyone in the country can have access to the advantages of our platform,&#8221; Wang added.</p>
<p>DiDi first entered the Chilean market in June, with 16,000 registered drivers in the resort town of Valparaiso. In August, the company started operating in Santiago.</p>

<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, a main extract of marijuana which is popular in the European and US markets, is being sold as health products on several Chinese e-commerce platforms including Taobao, jd.com and pinduoduo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In countries where marijuana is legal, the product is listed as a psychoactive drug.</p>
<p>Pinduoduo confirmed with the Global Times on Tuesday that it had removed all CBD products from its platform, but they are still available on Taobao and jd.com.</p>
<p>More than 20 shops appear on Taobao when &#8220;CBD&#8221; is typed into the search bar. Monthly figures differ from 10 to 400 sales for a single product.</p>
<p>A 1-gram bottle of medicine in the shop on Taobao has more than 200 reviews. Many customer reviews show that they have made multiple purchases, with nearly half taking it daily.</p>
<p>The oil&#8217;s product description shows that the addictive ingredient &#8211; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the hallucinogenic component of marijuana &#8211; has been removed.</p>
<p>A customer service representative from a shop on Taobao told the Global Times on Tuesday that the product is safe and has no side effects. He was vague about whether or not this product is a psychotropic drug, or if it needs a doctor&#8217;s advice to be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of customers said that after use, the effect used to treat insomnia is very good,&#8221; said the service representative.</p>
<p>CBD is not a controlled drug in China because of its lack of psychoactive activity, and it is not included in the international drug control convention schedule or the Chinese list of narcotic drugs, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no clear guidance on the sale of CBD in the Chinese market, and experts have warned of the problems caused by a lack of regulations, as CBD products in the market are not guaranteed to be free of THC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drug control laws and regulations shall apply to products containing more than 0.3 percent THC in China, according to Chinese law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;CBD oil that has more than 0.3 percent THC is strictly controlled in accordance with national laws and regulations. Any business that violates the law will be punished by Taobao and reported to law enforcement departments,&#8221; an Alibaba corporate spokesperson told the Global Times.</p>
<p>All the products are imported from the US, where CBD oil is seen as a psychoactive drug, according to their introduction page.</p>
<p>It is not possible to see if the sellers have a license from customs for drug imports and exports. Despite this, import and export licenses for psychotropic drugs should be provided when importing or exporting CBD, in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the General Administration of Customs.</p>

<p>Chinese tech firm ByteDance has begun investing in real-time audio and video streaming through an investment in TrackView, which offers online video-conferencing and other services, dismissing fresh rumors about the company investing in mobile security.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Technology, one of ByteDance’s subsidiaries based in Beijing, has launched an investment in Suzhou TrackView Technology, which is based in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, a spokesperson for ByteDance told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Technology has recently taken a minority stake in Suzhou TrackView Technology, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“The real-time audio and video streaming technology behind TeamLink, the company’s flagship video-conferencing product, is potentially applicable in live-streaming and online education use cases,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Tech will not participate in the company&#8217;s management or operations, she noted.</p>
<p>As a provider of comprehensive services in social media and new media, it is reasonable for ByteDance to keep expanding its businesses in various sectors, especially to obtain businesses that could form synergistic effects with its current operations, Liu Dingding, an independent analyst in the internet sector, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>ByteDance is an internet technology company founded in Beijing in 2012. It launched popular products including the online content platform Toutiao and the short video platform Tik Tok.</p>
<p>Its products and services are now available in 150 countries and regions, and in 75 languages, according to ByteDance’s website.</p>
<p>It is a common trend for Chinese tech firms to lay out operations or investments in different areas in both domestic and overseas markets, Liu noted.</p>
<p>Chinese tech giant Tencent has launched over 100 investments overseas, and its game business alone covers 200 countries and regions, according to a report by stcn.com on November 26.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<p>Foreign investors have been reinforcing their purchasing power on Chinese bonds, official data showed. Analysts give credit to the reform and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market, and&nbsp;bigger interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investors jumped at Chinese bonds in the first 11 months of the year, with cumulative net purchases reaching 970.2 billion yuan ($137.77 billion), data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) showed on Monday. That meant the total cumulative net purchases from foreign investors have approached nearly 1 trillion yuan in the first 11 months.</p>
<p>In November, transactions by foreign investors came to a total of 567 billion yuan, up 5 percent month-on-month and 127 percent year-on-year, CFETS said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November was the 12th consecutive month that foreign investors snapped up Chinese bonds. It is also notable that the number of foreign investors new to China&#8217;s interbank bonds market in the first 11 months &#8211; 1,331 &#8211; has surpassed the total number in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market have enabled more foreign investors to enter China&#8217;s financial market, as reflected by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and the country&#8217;s great efforts to build the yuan&#8217;s offshore financial market, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the risk of investing overseas is increasing with a declining yield rate under the pressure of the global economic downturn … but China&#8217;s bonds have relatively good returns on investment,&#8221; Liu noted, adding that foreigners&#8217; increasing purchasing power shows their confidence in China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 marks the lowest-performing year for global bond yields, but the interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds have surged to an historical peak, the China Securities Journal reported on Tuesday. Statistics showed the 10-year bond spreads between China and the US have surpassed 140 basis points, which is relatively high historically, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the first 10 months, Kazakhstan topped the list of Xinjiang&#8217;s major trade partners, with trade volume between the two growing by 28.2 percent to 60.2 billion yuan.</p>

<br />China&#8217;s central bank continued to pump cash into the money market in November to meet liquidity demand from financial institutions.</p>
<p>A total of 600 billion yuan (about 85.4 billion U.S. dollars) was injected into the market via the medium-term lending facility (MLF) last month to maintain liquidity in the banking system at a reasonably sufficient level, according to the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC).</p>
<p>The funds will mature in one year at an interest rate of 3.25 percent.</p>
<p>Total outstanding MLF loans reached 3.56 trillion yuan as of the end of November.</p>
<p>The MLF tool was introduced in 2014 to help commercial and policy banks maintain liquidity by allowing them to borrow from the central bank using securities as collateral.</p>
<p>In November, the PBOC also injected 4.8 billion yuan of funds through pledged supplementary lending to the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Agricultural Development Bank of China.</p>
<p>Another 62.25 billion yuan was lent to financial institutions through the standing lending facility to meet provisional liquidity demand.</p>
<p>The central bank has adopted open market operations more frequently to manage liquidity in a more flexible and targeted manner.</p>
<p>China has pledged to keep its prudent monetary policy &#8220;neither too tight nor too loose&#8221; while maintaining market liquidity at a reasonably ample level in 2019.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Tourists visit a scenic spot at Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong, south China, Nov. 14, 2019. The number of visitor arrivals to Hong Kong has witnessed the sharpest decline in 16 years for the third quarter of 2019 over continued unrest in the region, official data showed Wednesday. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang)</p>
<p>Hong Kong is poised to experience the first budget deficit in 15 years in the fiscal year that ends in March 2020, as months of riots are battering hurting Hong Kong&#8217;s traditional economic sectors, like retail and catering, that were normally big tax contributors, experts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But active fiscal expenditure is necessary, one expert said, as Hong Kong needs policy stimulation so that its riot-hit consumption can recover.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on Monday predicted the potential budget deficit. He attributed it to declines in the city&#8217;s tax income and land sales due to social unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Around the middle of the year, we rolled out some remedial measures. So at the end of this financial year next March, the Hong Kong Special&nbsp;</p>
<p>Administrative Region (HKSAR) government might be in the red,&#8221; said Chan, according to the info.gov.hk.</p>
<p>An underlying reason behind the looming budget deficit is that the ongoing riots besetting Hong Kong are hitting parts of the city&#8217;s economy that have been big tax contributors, such as retail and tourism, Liu Guohong, director of the Department of Finance and Modern Industries at the China Development Institute in Shenzhen, told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s retail sales slumped by 24.3 percent year-on-year in October, according to data released by Hong Kong&#8217;s Census and Statistics Department on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slump was worse than market expectations of 22.6 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lin Jiang, an economics professor at Lingnan College, Sun Yat-sen University, said that the poor balance sheet exposes Hong Kong&#8217;s imbalanced industrial structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong has been too reliant on a few traditional industries like real estate. When those sectors experience difficulties, there are no other industries to offset the slump and prop up the economy like what the internet and high-technology&nbsp; industries did for the Chinese mainland economy,&#8221; Lin said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong lost its income/revenue balance at a time when its economy has been badly hurt as a result of the months-long violence. According to Chan, Hong Kong&#8217;s economy this year will contract by 1.3 percent, the first annual decline since 2009.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many industries have entered winter&#8230;months of violence have slashed the international community&#8217;s and investors&#8217; confidence in Hong Kong&#8230;the city&#8217;s business prospects in 2020 will be full of challenges,&#8221; Chan said, calling on violence to be curbed and rational discussions to be carried out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there remains a bright side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chan said that the HKSAR government is still in a healthy fiscal position, given the city&#8217;s reserves in past years. He also placed great hopes on the city&#8217;s financial sector, saying on Sunday that Hong Kong&#8217;s social instability has had a limited influence on the city&#8217;s financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lin said that many Hong Kong social organizations have called for Hong Kong people to &#8220;rescue themselves&#8221; by encouraging them to increase consumption, and those efforts have paid off to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I visited the New Town Plaza in Shatin a few days ago and found that it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>bustling with businesses and people. It was as if things went back to the days before the riots,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also said that the Hong Kong government has made the right choice to stick to an expanding fiscal policy, saying that it could encourage people to spend and help businesses recover.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">China Mobile tests 5G network of over 1,000 Mbps in Qingdao, East China&#8217;s Shandong Province, in October. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>News that a Chinese visiting scholar lost contact for two days during a trip to a forest due to a poor mobile phone connection has gone viral on Chinese social media, with users teasing the low quality of mobile coverage in the US and analysts stressing the importance of Huawei to the country&#8217;s telecoms development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese visiting scholar Wang Mianmian, who visited a forest on Friday and soon after lost contact, was reported missing to police by her family, according to a media report.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wang on Monday was able to reconnect to her mobile network, posting on her Wechat moments, &#8220;I am back, no worries, I did not notice the mobile phone connection in the US is poor. Sorry for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s experience later spread across Chinese social media, with users complaining about the poor mobile phone connection in the US and criticizing the telecoms construction from capital-driven carriers in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telecoms development in the US is relatively lagging. It is ok in major cities, but the mobile phone connection in some rural areas is very poor or even non-existent,&#8221; a user of Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao said in a comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citing the example of the Yellow Stone National Park, the user said that there is no connection in most of the park, and if one can be found, it is hard to even make a phone call for help.</p>
<p>A Sina Weibo user said that, unlike China&#8217;s national construction model that takes less-populated rural areas under same consideration as large cities, the capital-driven construction in the US has made a different choice.</p>
<p>The user&#8217;s comment was echoed by an industry analyst.</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s incident also shows that the telecoms construction in the US cannot continue without Huawei, a Chinese telecoms solution provider that has been facing challenges in the US, Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major telecoms carriers, who are capital-oriented companies, mostly focus on highly populated areas rather than rural regions, so the telecoms construction in less-populated areas generally needs to rely on small, local carriers,&#8221; Xiang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;But these small carriers usually don&#8217;t have enough capital to build optical-fiber-based networks. It is almost the case that only Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE can provide affordable alternative solutions for them, so they cannot leave Huawei,&#8221; Xiang added.</p>
<p>According to Xiang, thus far, there are roughly 12 million mobile network base stations globally, including 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G stations, of which China has about 8 million and the US about 400,000. China has more than 4 million 4G stations while the US has roughly 200,000.</p>

<p>China won&#8217;t use the yuan&#8217;s exchange rate as an instrument, and it will refrain from a beggar-thy-neighbor policy and&nbsp; strengthen efforts to advance reform of a market-based mechanism of the yuan exchange rate, said Yi Gang, governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC) on Sunday.</p>
<p>Yi published an article in Qiushi Journal on Sunday, titled &#8220;Stick to the Goal of Currency Stability and Implement a Prudent Monetary Policy&#8221;, saying the yuan&#8217;s exchange rate is determined by market supply and demand, and China should refrain from quantitative easing even if the monetary policies of major economies are heading toward zero interest rates.</p>
<p>Qiushi Journal, published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is one of the most influential and authoritative magazines devoted to governance and theoretical studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the next stage, the PBC will continue to promote the reform of the market-based mechanism of the yuan exchange rate, keep the exchange rate flexible, and implement necessary macro-prudential management when the market shows pro-cyclical signs,&#8221; wrote Yi.</p>
<p>China has followed a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand since 1994. China improved its exchange rate mechanism in 2005, when the yuan exchange rate no longer floated only with the US dollar, but with a currency basket.</p>
<p>Ding Meng, senior strategy analyst of Bank of China&#8217;s Macao Branch, told the Global Times that a market-driven mechanism will increase exchange rate volatility, so the central bank should reduce risk by guiding pricing &#8212; for example, in the quarterly China Monetary Policy Report.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is expected that the counter-cyclical adjustment of policy will continue to intensify,&#8221; Guo Xiaobei, a researcher with China Minsheng Bank, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under a prudent tone, monetary policy has effectively lowered the financing cost of the real economy through comprehensive reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cuts, targeted interest rate cuts and loan prime rate reform, and maintained reasonable and sufficient liquidity,&#8221; said Guo.</p>
<p>Yi also mentioned that monetary policy will serve the real economy and high-quality development of China&#8217;s economic growth. China should respect the laws of the economy, and GDP is not the only indicator of economic growth, Yi wrote in the journal.</p>
<p>According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the average GDP growth rate in the first three quarters of 2019 was 6.2 percent. In the first quarter, it was 6.4 percent, while it was 6.2 percent in the second quarter and 6.0 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s economy is big and thus it&#8217;s difficult to always maintain growth above 6 percent. Now the Chinese economy has moved toward high-quality development, so a slowdown in GDP growth is acceptable,&#8221; Jing Linbo, dean of China Academy of Social Sciences Evaluation Studies, told the Global Times.</p>

<p>Airlines in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) are cutting flights and capacity to tackle with the declining demand of the city&#8217;s aviation industry brought about by months of unrest, while neighboring Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, has been expanding international flights to meet surging transport demand.</p>
<p>Experts on Sunday noted that the stability of society as well as economic growth constitute the basis of the development of the aviation industry, and the city&#8217;s restoration of order is the premise for Hong Kong&#8217;s aviation industry to resume its leading position in the world.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Airlines announced on Friday that it will cease flights to Canada&#8217;s Vancouver, Vietnam&#8217;s Ho Chi Minh City and North China&#8217;s Tianjin Municipality &#8212; the second time for the airline to suspend long-distance flights within one month. It announced on November 4 that it would end flights to Los Angeles, starting from February 8, 2020.</p>
<p>The continuous unrest has cast a shadow on Hong Kong&#8217;s business environment, and the company will focus on primary air routes and reduce flights and capacity in the following months, read the statement of Hong Kong Airlines on Friday. It noted that weak demand in the tourism sector would affect the operations and income of the airline.</p>
<p>According to data from the Hong Kong Tourism Board, visitor arrivals in October slumped 43.7 percent year-on-year, with tourist arrivals from the Chinese mainland down 45.9 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Another Hong Kong-based airline, Cathay Pacific, recorded decreases in passengers and cargo transport in October. The company carried about 2.74 million passengers in October, a drop of 7.1 percent year-on-year, read a statement sent to the Global Times by Cathay Pacific.</p>
<p>The airline reduced its passenger flight capacity by 2-4 percent between August and October, and by 6-7 percent for November and December, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific drew criticism from netizens in the Chinese mainland due to its ambiguous attitude toward<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//content/968898.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong riot</a>ers when the radical protests burst out, and some of its employees reportedly supported the rioters. Chinese mainland netizens even called for a boycott of the airline.</p>
<p>&#8220;A certain degree of business contraction is reasonable for Hong Kong airlines, given that the city has not completely restored order,&#8221; Wu Minghua, a veteran transport industry analyst, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Stable economic growth is another essential basis for the development of the aviation industry, Wu said, noting that the mounting downward pressure on Hong Kong&#8217;s economy is another negative factor.</p>
<p>It may take a long time for the industry to resume its former scale and market share, Wu noted.</p>
<p>By contrast, Shenzhen announced that, after eight new international routes launched this year, it will roll out more international flights in the near future. The Shenzhen International Airport&#8217;s annual international passenger capacity will exceed 5 million for the first time, said a statement on the news site of the Shenzhen government, sz.gov.cn.</p>
