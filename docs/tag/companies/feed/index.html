<p>Huawei&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is under the spotlight from Chinese netizens again, but this time for her taste in fashion.</p>
<p>Following the one-year anniversary of Meng&#8217;s arrest in Canada on Sunday, she said in an open letter that she was &#8220;no longer afraid of the unknown&#8221; despite moments of fear and torment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her relaxed and fearless attitude has clearly influenced Chinese internet users. On social media, people have begun to pay attention to things outside of her legal proceedings &#8211; Meng&#8217;s outfits at several court appearances.</p>
<p>Some users on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo said that Meng&#8217;s ensembles when she appears in court are eye-catching and change the stereotypically conservative image of Chinese businesswomen.</p>
<p>Some fashion bloggers have listed her outfits and their corresponding brands from each public appearance.</p>
<p>One look featuring a Max Mara tobacco-colored cashmere coat, and another featuring a black Chanel coat, were compared to similar court outfits worn by former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy when she sued a paparazzo.</p>
<p>In addition to her clothes, Meng&#8217;s shoes were also widely discussed &#8211; her sparkling Jimmy Choos were a particular delight for netizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GPS monitor strapped to her ankle looks like a fashion accessory with her calm attitude and confidence,&#8221; said a fashion blogger.</p>
<p>Some netizens said that her outfits have been praised because they reflect Meng&#8217;s strong, confident spirit and positive energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her confidence and bravery should be admired, as she always holds her head high when making public appearances,&#8221; said a Sina Weibo user.</p>

<br />China&#8217;s ride-hailing giant DiDi kicked off operations in 13 more Chilean cities on Tuesday, bringing the total to 23.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s expansion means the service is available from north to south, with five northern cities of Arica, Iquique, Calama, Copiapo and Ovalle and seven southern cities of Curico, Chillan, Los Angeles, Valdivia, Osorno, Coyhaique and Punta Arenas, as well as the central city of Los Andes, now within DiDi&#8217;s sphere of operations.</p>
<p>DiDi&#8217;s ride-sharing and taxi services have been well-received in the South American country, enabling the company&#8217;s rapid expansion, said Simeng Wang, general manager of DiDi Chile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very thankful for the support and reception we have had since the starting in Chile,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, without a doubt, DiDi&#8217;s commitment is to deliver a better service at a more convenient price, so everyone in the country can have access to the advantages of our platform,&#8221; Wang added.</p>
<p>DiDi first entered the Chilean market in June, with 16,000 registered drivers in the resort town of Valparaiso. In August, the company started operating in Santiago.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei logo File photo: IC</p>
<p>Chinese telecom giant Huawei is facing intense fire on Chinese social media after the company reportedly played a role in sending a former employee to be detained for more than 250 days and failed to quell widespread criticism.</p>
<p>The growing criticism of Huawei, which has won broad support from the Chinese public in its fight against the US crackdown over the past year or so, marks a significant shift in public sentiment toward the company and sparks discussion about the country&#8217;s ever-growing tech giants&#8217; treatment of employees.</p>
<p>Huawei grabbed the spotlight again following news reports that Huawei tipped off the authorities, claiming Li Hongyuan, who worked in the company for 12 years and sought 300,000 yuan ($42,511.68) in severance compensation as he left Huawei in 2018, blackmailed the company, which eventually led to Li&#8217;s detention by public security departments in Shenzhen for 251 days, according to media reports. In August, Li was acquitted after the procuratorate in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, where Huawei is headquartered, decided to drop the case because of insufficient evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 25, Li was awarded 100,000 yuan in state compensation for his detention and asked Huawei to repair damages to his reputation. Li has also demanded an apology and a meeting with Huawei executives but received no response from the company.</p>
<p>After growing criticism on social media (the topic of Li&#8217;s demand for an apology from Huawei saw 240 million views on Sina Weibo as of Tuesday night), Huawei on Monday issued a statement, which not only failed to dispel criticism but sparked a new wave of outrage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei has the right and also the obligation to report suspected illegal conducts to the judicial authorities based on facts,&#8221; reads the statement. &#8220;If Li Hongyuan thinks his rights and interests have been damaged, we support him to take legal weapons to protect them, including suing Huawei.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li said that the statement from Huawei was hardly comforting.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m going home now… freedom is now more important than anything,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Tuesday&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that Huawei has not reached Li or his family directly on the matter but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>On Chinese social media the reactions to Huawei&#8217;s statement was furious, with some calling Huawei unapologetic and arrogant. Others argued that Huawei can treat the case based entirely on laws but it lacks human compassion.</p>
<p>But there is also no shortage of support for Huawei, with some arguing that Huawei did what it had to do to protect its own interests by using legal means and should not bow to public opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Huawei bowed to public opinion and apologized, it would send a signal to others that they can also start trouble [for Huawei] to gain more interests. If that happens, thousands leave Huawei each year, can it still operate normally?&#8221; Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, wrote in an article on Tuesday. &#8220;If it takes actions in accordance with the law, then it should be bold and straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s case came just days after a similar case involving another Chinese telecom firm NetEase, which also faced heavy criticism after an employee claimed that he got fired after he was terminally ill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, the employee said in a statement reported by several media outlets that he had settled the dispute with the company, which sincerely apologized and offered full support in his treatment.</p>
<p>The back-to-back cases also renewed heated discussion over working conditions at Chinese tech companies, with some questioning the tech world&#8217;s so-called &#8220;996&#8221; work hour system, where employees work from 9 am to 9 pm and six days a week.</p>
<p>While some criticized the work schedule, others expressed understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s solar technology company Longi Green Energy Technology has obtained an order to sell solar cell modules to India&#8217;s Adani Green Energy, according to a statement the Chinese firm released recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the agreement, a wholly owned unit of the Shaanxi-based company will sell monocrystalline solar cell modules of 500 megawatts to 1,200 megawatts to Adani Green Energy in 2020, accounting for 20 percent of its monocrystalline solar cell module exports in 2018 if calculated at a ceiling of 1,200 megawatts.</p>
<p>Longi is a global leading monocrystalline silicon wafer supplier, with over 40 percent of the global market share in 2018.</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada Goose, Hatley, Factors Group &#8211; what do those names have in common? They are all Canadian companies that increased investment in China recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those companies&#8217; moves show a warming-up trend in bilateral economic relations between China and Canada, as Canadian enterprises value business opportunities in the Chinese market and won&#8217;t stop their investment plans because of external pressure, experts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada Goose, for example, made a choice to continue exploring the Chinese mainland market despite business setbacks arising from the two countries&#8217; cooling relations. In November, the Canadian jacket maker opened a new store in a Shanghai luxury shopping mall, its fifth store in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new store got a positive response from local customers. At around noon on Tuesday, customers had to wait in queue for half an hour to enter the shop. The waiting time could be over one hour during weekends, one shop assistant told the Global Times at the entrance of the store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some customers have traveled from other regions like Suzhou and Anhui, just to shop at the store,&#8221; the shopping assistant said, adding that some designs had already sold out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One customer, wearing a dark green Canada Goose jacket, told the Global Times that she passed by the store and dropped in to see if she could get something for her relatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A year ago, Canada Goose was caught in the crossfire following Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou&#8217;s arrest in Vancouver. The company experienced a steep share price drop for nearly one week, but it didn&#8217;t halt steps to penetrate the Chinese market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada Goose had planned to arrange a group interview with one of the company&#8217;s senior executives but later cancelled it. The company didn&#8217;t reveal its financial data in China when contacted by the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of Canadian companies have made similar moves to increase their presence in China. Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons opened a store in Shanghai in February, its first store in the country. Children&#8217;s clothing maker Hatley and healthy food producer Factors Group signed deals during the recent China International Import Expo to bring more products to China, according to canadainternational.gc.ca.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A senior executive from the Canada-based telecom giant Ice Wireless, which is working with Huawei, said the company could deploy Huawei&#8217;s 5G &#8220;in the hinterland in short order,&#8221; according to a report of the Post Millennial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are signs that testify to the warming trade and investment relations between China and Canada, which had been affected by a bilateral chill over the Huawei issue, Zhou Rong, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s trade with Canada rose by 3.4 percent on a yearly basis to $54.4 billion in the first 10 months, customs data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese market is just too important for Canadian businesses to ignore. Being a country with vast land but relatively a small population, Canada needs a market to consume its products. Where else can Canada find such a market as China that has a large number of customers capable of spending?&#8221; Zhou said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their need to cling to the Chinese markets would turn more urgent as Canada&#8217;s economy slows down in recent months, said Zhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Zhou said it might take time for the Canadian government to further mend political relations with China. &#8220;But one thing is for sure, Canadian companies will increase investment in the Chinese market regardless of political friction,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While nuts have long been a favorable snack for festive seasons, China&#8217;s growing demand for nuts has created new opportunities for global suppliers.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2017, China&#8217;s nut industry increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15.7 percent, reaching 121 billion yuan ($17.2 billion) in 2017, according to the China Food Industry Association. Although inclement weather has driven nut prices higher this year, Chinese consumers have not been deterred in their enthusiasm for the snack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the consumption of nuts per capita is still below the global average, experts say the growing demand in quantity and quality is beginning to open up opportunities for the global nuts business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Increased demand</strong></span></p>
<p>Low temperature and rainfall in some nut producing areas in the US caused some apricot flower rots this spring, leading to a significant decline in US almond production. The US Department of Agriculture also lowered its almond output forecast for 2019. According to the department, the projected output in 2019 will be 2.2 million pounds in California, the key almond production region, down 3.5 percent from production last year. The average nut set per tree in 2019 is also down 17.8 percent from 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, prices of almonds in the US rose from $7 per kilogram in June to $7.9 per kilogram in October, a nearly 14 percent increase. The current price is approximately $7.61 per kilogram, an increase of 15 percent, according to a report on toutiao.com, a popular mobile news app in China.</p>
<p>The price increase and additional tariffs on US-imported nuts have put pressure on US nut importers. According to the Hengyi Food Imports and Exports Company based in Shanghai, the prices have increased from 10 to 15 percent depending on variety, but demand continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pistachios, for example can have a price up to 160 yuan per kilogram at its best quality this year, compared to around 120 to 140 yuan last year,&#8221; Hengyi&#8217;s manager surnamed Huang told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sale of nuts in the company did not seem to be affected by the mounting price, Huang said, due to overall increasing demand, as well as the approaching Spring Festival when people consume an increasing amount of nuts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest importer of pistachios, and around 10 percent of the world&#8217;s pistachios are consumed by Chinese buyers, according to a report by the growingproduce.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think as the consumers in China are becoming more demanding of the quality of the nuts and less deterred by its price, the imports are still to increase in near future,&#8221; Huang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Growing potential</strong></span></p>
<p>Behind the rising trend of nuts is the rising health awareness among Chinese consumers who see nuts as a healthy and flavorful snack. Middle class households have especially bought more nuts in recent years fueling unprecedented growth of the nut industry in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meiri Jianguo, a brand under Three Squirrels offering packets of nuts that claim to meet people&#8217;s daily meets for nuts have had their sales soar. According to a report by Three Squirrels, the company had already sold up to 100 million packets of nuts by early May. During this year&#8217;s online shopping festival, Double Eleven, it took less than twenty minutes for the brand to reach a sales volume of 100 million yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three Squirrels&#8217; success is but a small part of the quickly increasing popularity of nuts with Chinese consumers. There is massive room for potential development as consumption per capita is still below the average consumption worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report by the market research website chyxx.com, the consumption of some of the most popular nuts are below global average and drastically lower than some Western countries. In 2017, the average consumption of pistachios recorded in China was only 0.05 kilograms per person, as opposed to around 0.1 kilograms worldwide and about 0.5 kilograms in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the household disposable continues to grow, the demand is also expected to near global average,&#8221; said Zhu Danpeng, a Guangzhou-based food industry analyst. &#8220;Currently most of China&#8217;s imports comes from the US, Australia and some countries in the South America, but it will in the future turn to other key suppliers as its demand grows.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Zhu, the growing nuts market will be the biggest target for global nut suppliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of variety, there is also a huge opportunity. The most consumed nuts in China has traditionally been peanuts, but now people are trying new, more exotic varieties such as Brazil nuts and Macadamia,&#8221; Zhu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another Shanghai-based company SPI West Port Corp, which specializes in selling imported snacks including nuts, said that the company has now started importing nuts from the US and Thailand to meet demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most popular nuts are the honey roasted almonds from the US,&#8221; SPI&#8217;s manager surnamed Yi said, &#8220;but now we are also selecting some brands from Thailand to offer more options to the customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinese tech firm ByteDance has begun investing in real-time audio and video streaming through an investment in TrackView, which offers online video-conferencing and other services, dismissing fresh rumors about the company investing in mobile security.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Technology, one of ByteDance’s subsidiaries based in Beijing, has launched an investment in Suzhou TrackView Technology, which is based in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, a spokesperson for ByteDance told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Technology has recently taken a minority stake in Suzhou TrackView Technology, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“The real-time audio and video streaming technology behind TeamLink, the company’s flagship video-conferencing product, is potentially applicable in live-streaming and online education use cases,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Tech will not participate in the company&#8217;s management or operations, she noted.</p>
<p>As a provider of comprehensive services in social media and new media, it is reasonable for ByteDance to keep expanding its businesses in various sectors, especially to obtain businesses that could form synergistic effects with its current operations, Liu Dingding, an independent analyst in the internet sector, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>ByteDance is an internet technology company founded in Beijing in 2012. It launched popular products including the online content platform Toutiao and the short video platform Tik Tok.</p>
<p>Its products and services are now available in 150 countries and regions, and in 75 languages, according to ByteDance’s website.</p>
<p>It is a common trend for Chinese tech firms to lay out operations or investments in different areas in both domestic and overseas markets, Liu noted.</p>
<p>Chinese tech giant Tencent has launched over 100 investments overseas, and its game business alone covers 200 countries and regions, according to a report by stcn.com on November 26.</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Gree&#8217;s stock price closed high on Monday morning at 59.96 yuan ($8.65), after Gree said it will be without a controlling shareholder as the private equity firm Hillhouse Capital becomes the biggest shareholder of Gree Electric on Monday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Hillhouse Capital will take over 15 percent of Gree&#8217;s shares at a price of 41.6 billion yuan ($5.9 billion).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">As Hillhouse Capital takes over Gree&#8217;s shares, the company is now without an actual controlling shareholder and left with a new management system, which is deemed as a modern shareholding system. Numerous companies are under such a system, including Pingan and TCL, according to a report by yicai.com </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Market participants generally believe that with such a large quantity of investment, the cash flow will lead to higher dividend requirements from major shareholders. It is expected that Gree&#8217;s dividend rate will increase in the future, the report said. </span></p>

<p>Shao Hua, general manager of Heihe City Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd. of China Gas, said that the border city of Heihe still largely relies on coal for heat. With the Sino-Russian natural gas pipeline&#8217;s operation, the city now has access to a stable supply of clean energy.</p>
<p>Heihe has registered 30,000 households for switching to natural gas for heating. It will take one year to complete full coverage of the gas network in the city, according to the company.</p>
