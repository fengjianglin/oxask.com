<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />60-year-old Zhang Jinlai, the classic Monkey King for lots of Chinese people, announced on Monday that he will reenact the movie version of Monkey King.</p>
<p>Better known by his stage name Liu Xiao Ling Tong, Zhang&#8217;s announcement of his return to the big screen got some Chinese netizens excited, but also sparked some opposition on social media.</p>
<p>Zhang played the role of Monkey King in the 1986 classic TV series Journey to the West and its later 2000 sequel, which have been recounted in the memories of Chinese netizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;My happiest time of the day was when I sat in front of the TV and watched Journey to the West with my parents after dinner,&#8221; commented one netizen on Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>The new movie, also called Journey to the West, is directed by Han Yan, director of Animal World, and will use the technology of motion capture to finish the Monkey King&#8217;s filming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monkey King is the earliest hero in my mind and I grew up with him,&#8221; Han said when asked on social media why he shot the film about the mythological figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Liu Xiao Ling Tong deserves the title of Monkey King,&#8221; wrote another netizen.</p>
<p>Many netizens said that they will support the movie when it is released to &#8220;pay tribute to this classic from their younger years.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, some netizens worried that Zhang is unfit for high-intensity filming at his age. &#8220;He should take care of his health,&#8221; a Sina Weibo user commented.</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s compelling performance in Journey to the West was greatly praised by critics and helped him win the Best Actor award at the sixth Golden Eagle Awards in 1988.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Sunday jointly issued an outline of the integrated regional development of the Yangtze River Delta.</p>
<p>The document outlined targets, requirements and measures to boost the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta and build a regional cluster of high-quality development.</p>
<p>As one of China&#8217;s most economically active, open and innovative regions, the Yangtze River Delta boasts strategic significance in the country&#8217;s modernization and further opening-up, which makes its regional integration crucial for leading the country&#8217;s high-quality development and building a modern economic system.</p>
<p>The outline, mapping development for a 358,000-square km expanse that encompasses Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Anhui Province and Shanghai Municipality, consists of 12 chapters.</p>
<p>Tasks specified in the outline include establishing a coordinated innovative industry system, enhancing connectivity of infrastructure, strengthening environmental protection, advancing public services and building the Shanghai free trade zone under high standards.</p>
<p>The document detailed development goals to be achieved by 2025 and offered visions into 2035.</p>
<p>By 2025, the Yangtze River Delta is to see substantial development and basically realize integration in the science and innovation industry, infrastructure, environment and public services, said the document.</p>
<p>To fulfill integrated development in the science and innovation sector by 2025, the ratio of the region&#8217;s R&amp;D spending to its gross domestic product (GDP) should top 3 percent, while its output of high-tech industries should account for 18 percent of total industrial output.</p>
<p>In the same period, connectivity of infrastructure will be represented by improvements in railway and expressway density and a 5G network coverage of 80 percent.</p>
<p>The outline also laid out environment standards to be met by 2025 in terms of PM2.5 density and energy consumption per unit of GDP.</p>
<p>By 2025, accomplishments in public services should put per capita fiscal expenditure at 21,000 yuan (about 2,987 U.S. dollars) and extend the average life expectancy to 79 years, according to the outline.</p>
<p>The outline also called for a unified market system marked by openness and the free flow of resources.</p>
<p>Looking further into the future, the outline envisioned the Yangtze River Delta as the most influential and robust driving force of the nation&#8217;s development by 2035.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is out on bail and remains under partial house arrest after she was detained last year at the behest of American authorities, leaves her home to attend a court hearing in Vancouver, on September 23.

<p>Calls were still loud Sunday on Chinese social media for the release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou one year after her arrest in Vancouver&nbsp;airport at the request of the US.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has evolved to be a linchpin in a stalemate between China and Canada, Chinese observers say, noting that breakthroughs made by the Chinese telecommunications giant over the past year prove that the US attempt to contain Huawei&#8217;s achievements and China&#8217;s technological rise has and will continue to come to naught.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cong Peiwu, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also paid a visit to Meng in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government is determined to protect the just and legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and enterprises, and will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible,&#8221; Cong said, as quoted in a statement posted Friday on the website of the Embassy in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition proceedings for Meng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei&#8217;s daughter, are scheduled for January, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has yet to respond to&nbsp;the Global Times&#8217; request for disclosure on the progress of the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detention of Meng has deeply hurt China-Canada relations, and both Canada and the US have staked their international reputations on the case, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US request for Meng&#8217;s extradition from Canada is destined to end in failure, he believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition request was based on insufficient evidence, which means it would be impossible for the request to be justified in the Canadian legal system, Yang asserted.</p>
<p>A thorough and complicated procedure must be gone through before any extradition request is validated, he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case will most likely either become &#8220;a protracted juridical war that may last 10 years or even longer,&#8221; or result in a solution that all the three sides involved can agree on, he added, stressing that the solution won&#8217;t be what the US wants.</p>
<p>Huawei has also become a bone of contention in the China-US trade tensions, during which the US has launched multiple offensives against Huawei.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A temporary experience store of Huawei in Shanghai on Saturday Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In the words of Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, China has not given in at the trade talks with the US and Huawei has not collapsed amid the US-initiated blockage.</p>
<p>In a fresh move, the US Federal Communications Commission announced a decision on November 22 barring the use of an $8.5 billion government fund to buy equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Huawei said it would make an announcement at an event in its Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday about filing suit to challenge the FCC&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based technology giant has reportedly secured over 50 commercial 5G contracts across the globe, with 28 from Europe, 11 from the Middle East, six from the Asia-Pacific, four from the Americas, and one from Africa, the company revealed in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Huawei said it had delivered over 200,000 5G base stations and built nearly two-thirds of all 5G base stations shipped globally.</p>
<p>The US blockage has prompted Huawei to shift toward Japan for imports of chips and other core components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has pioneered the nation&#8217;s push for indigenous technological prowess, Xiang told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering Huawei&#8217;s flagship 5G system on a chip (SoC) as an example of the company&#8217;s edge over its global rivals in terms of core technology, Xiang reckoned the company has largely weathered the US attempt to contain Chinese tech products and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest data from Berlin-based market intelligence platform IPlytics showed, as of November, Huawei&#8217;s declared 5G patents total 3,325, topping the global 5G declaration rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies following Huawei include Samsung with 2,846, LG with 2,463, Nokia with 2,308 and ZTE with 2,204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest-rated US company is Qualcomm at seventh 7th with 1,330 declared 5G patents.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 companies could be exempted or partially exempted from the requirement to reduce emissions during polluted days in northern China in winter, according to an upcoming classification rule from the environment authority.</p>
<p>Companies in 15 key industries such as steel, coking and petroleum will be divided in to A, B and C levels in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>A-level companies are those which lead in their industries and are models for other companies to look to when upgrading and reconstructing, Liu Youbin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said on Friday during a press conference.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 companies that have advanced producing technologies and highly efficient facilities to tackle pollution will not need to reduce emissions, or will only need to reduce emissions during high-level emergency alerts for air pollution.</p>
<p>The companies are from industries which are newly-developed, strategic or concern people&#8217;s livelihood.</p>
<p>Coal-fired power plants used specifically for railways will be fully exempted.</p>
<p>Relevant companies will be exempted from halting their production, and supervision will decrease.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Ecology and Environment released a direction for the classification in July.</p>
<p>The final results of the classification will be announced by provincial-level environmental departments.</p>
<p>During the press conference on Friday, the ministry also announced progress on pollution-prevention work concerning soil, underground water, ecology and the environment in rural areas.</p>
