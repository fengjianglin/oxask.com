<p class="MsoNormal">
<p>Chinese netizens denounced Zhejiang TV station (Zhejiang STV) for its response to the death of Taiwan island actor Godfrey Gao, and posted 20 questions on the official Sina Weibo account for Gao&#8217;s fans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Weibo account &#8220;Gao Yixiang ba�?posted 20 questions and called on Zhejiang STV to give a public reply to Gao&#8217;s death in the show &#8220;Chase Me&#8221; on November 27.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Gao&#8217;s body was finally returned home six days after the incident. Zhejiang STV only gave an explanation to the public by posting two announcements without an official seal and used money to influence public opinion, divert attention and cover it up. We don&#8217;t want your hypocritical apology. We want the truth!�?the post read. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 20 questions are about the reasons why the TV station did not conduct more timely rescue efforts when Gao fell to the ground and their delayed response to the whole incident.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The hashtag of 20 questions to Zhejiang STV has gained 850 million views on Weibo and many Chinese netizens commended Weibo for asking the station to give a proper reply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Do you still have a conscience? For the recording effect of the program, Gao fell down but you continued to record the program and missed the golden rescue time. We need the truth,�?one netizen said <a name="_GoBack"></a>on Weibo.</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Technicians work in a Manchu embroidery studio in Shenyang, capital of northeast China&#8217;s Liaoning Province, Nov. 23, 2018. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>A Manchu language&nbsp;inheritor said on Tuesday that only about 200 to 300 people in China are able to speak the critically endangered language.</p>
<p>Tan Shanshan, a 33-year-old language inheritor whose ancestor belongs to the Plain White Banner, one of the eight banners of Manchu military and society, has opened online and offline Manchu classes in Ningguta, Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province, to try to save the endangered language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoken by the Manchu, one of China&#8217;s ethnic minority groups, the language originated from the region between China and the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>. It was one of the official languages of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and was spoken among the people in court and bureaucracy as a symbol of their advanced hierarchy. However, after the end of the Qing Dynasty, the prominence of the Manchu language declined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are nearly 10 million Manchus in China, most of which living in provinces in Northeast China, a large majority speak Putonghua (Standard Chinese). According to UNESCO&#8217;s Atlas of the World&#8217;s Languages in Danger in 2016, only 20 people in the world still spoke Manchu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My passion for Manchu is not only to learn the language well, but also to get more people speaking and writing in Manchu. I do not want it to exit the world forever,&#8221; Tan said in an interview with Chinese media outlet Pear Video on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The hashtag for the classes earned 160 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Tuesday, with many Chinese netizens saying they support the conservation of China&#8217;s ethnic minority languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel ashamed when someone asks me if I can speak Manchu. I hope one day I can speak it fluently,&#8221; one ethnic Manchu student who asked to remain anonymous told Pear Video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a good idea to open Manchu language classes because people who are interest in the culture might learn more when they master the language,&#8221; Zhou Wei, a teacher at Tianjin Foreign Studies Universities who is Manchu on her mother&#8217;s side, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Zhou also pointed that Manchu language learning tends to be more research-oriented since only a few people can speak it and it is difficult to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the report from news outlet china.com.cn, the Manchu alphabet is based on the Mongolian alphabet and is written from top to bottom. Manchu letters are written vertically from top to bottom with columns going from left to right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally think the language&#8217;s research value is much higher than its usage value. We need to record the language system including the pronunciation of words, grammar and some special usages. But if we take it as a kind of cultural renaissance, that would be a useless effort,&#8221; Zhou said.</p>

<p>The World Heritage application for the Tea Horse Road by China, Mongolia and Russia, will serve as an example for international cooperation, according to Sergey Kalashnikov, chairman of the Russia International Cooperation Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cooperation among China, Mongolia and Russia on this application process will not only promote the cultural and economic development of the countries, provinces, cities and counties along the ancient Tea Horse Road but also provide new perspectives for international cooperation on culture, technology and trade, Sergey said.</p>
<p>Sergey made the remarks at a forum on the application process which was held in the city of Wuyishan in East China&#8217;s Fujian Province on Sunday. Attendees of the forum include scholars from China, Mongolia and Russia, as well as representatives from cities along the road.</p>
<p>The ancient Tea Horse Road, which dates back to the 17th century, was a network of ancient trade routes that came into being after the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>. It passed through Chinese provinces including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei and Shanxi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and extended to Mongolia and Russia.</p>
<p>The ancient Tea Horse Road was inscribed on the &#8220;World Heritage Tentative List in China&#8221; in March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese young director Diao Yinan&#8217;s latest work<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> held its China premiere on Sunday in Beijing ahead of its nationwide debut on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crime film will compete with Brad Pitt&#8217;s space-themed blockbuster AD Astra and Chinese movie The Whistleblower starring Tang Wei and Lei Jiayin.</p>
<p>Another of the director&#8217;s signature black humor movies,<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> takes place in Wuhan, Central China&#8217;s Hubei Province, and follows a detective who is hunting down a suspect on the run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the premiere, Diao said that the film mainly focuses on people living in the margins of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are often ignored, but we can always find something bright about them. The suspect Zhou Zenong at the begining is running from the reality of life. But one day, he has to face death and a chance to save himself as well. What he faces is a philosophical question which all people must deal with,&#8221; Diao said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Renowned Latvian maestro Mariss Jansons, who conducted some of the world&#8217;s most prestigious orchestras, has died at his home in Saint Petersburg, Russian authorities said on Sunday. He was 76.</p>
<p>Jansons, who had suffered from heart problems, died of cardiac arrest, according to people close to his family quoted by Russian media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sincere gratitude for his great art will always remain with us,&#8221; Saint Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov said in a statement, calling him &#8220;an outstanding conductor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considered one of the leading conductors to emerge from the former Soviet Union, Jansons was born in the Latvian capital Riga in 1943, the son of the renowned conductor Arvid Jansons, who died in 1984.</p>
<p>The family moved to Leningrad, the present-day Saint Petersburg, in 1956, where he studied violin, piano and conducting at the conservatory.</p>
<p>Jansons also studied under world-famous conductors Herbert von Karajan and Yevgeny Mravinsky.</p>
<p>He had directed the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra since 2003 after leading other well-known ensembles such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>A highly valued guest conductor, he collaborated with almost every major orchestra in the world in recent years.</p>
<p>He was also a part of the very exclusive club which conducted the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra for the New Year&#8217;s concert, chosen by the musicians themselves, in 2006, 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;We received the sad and shocking news of the death of Mariss Jansons this morning,&#8221; the Vienna Philharmonic said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lions, giraffe, zebras, monkeys… a new exhibition featuring the artwork of Chinese artist Shen Shubin has turned the Beijiao Cultural Center in Foshan, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, into a painted zoo with his animal-themed works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Creative Evolution exhibition features dozens of his paintings from this year including<br />
<em>The Rational Meaning of Beijing</em> series and<br />
<em>Orientation</em> series as well as some of his classic works like the<br />
<em>Embrace</em> series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shen began creating animal-inspired art years ago. According to the artist, he has been an animal lover since childhood, a time when he liked to play with cats, dogs and even rabbits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early<br />
<em>Embrace</em> series, you will see animals embrace each other even though some of them are enemies,&#8221; the artist said at a talk prior to the opening of the exhibition on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can see a clear message of understanding, reconciliation and peace.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Shen does is to find a balance between reality and ideals. The ruins appearing in his paintings from time to time show his thoughts on today&#8217;s society and the reconstruction of human society,&#8221; exhibition curator Gao Yuan told media at the opening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to portray these animals, Shen often spends a lot of time researching them and watching them in videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, even more important is the feelings behind these creatures, which delivers a certain message to viewers,&#8221; the artist said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exhibition is set to run until December 10 before touring to the artist&#8217;s hometown in North China&#8217;s Shanxi Province.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is also one of the hosts of a TV program broadcast on Hunan Satellite Television. On Sunday night&#8217;s program, Wang performed crosstalk, a traditional Chinese comedy performance usually involving dialogue between two people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening everyone. I am a new crosstalk performer, Wang Yabo,&#8221; he said. In Chinese yabo means duck neck. The humorous self-introduction amused Chinese netizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is good at performing crosstalk. Calling himself &#8216;duck neck&#8217; is so cute,&#8221; one netizen commented on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>South Korean girl band Cosmic Girls returned to the stage recently to promote their new EP<br />
<em>As You Wish</em>, which was released on November 19. But Chinese netizens became worried that their dance routines may be too intense and that their many performances may take a toll on their health after a screenshot of supposed quotes from members in Korean began circulating on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time after finishing a performance, I am pale and out of breath.&#8221; &#8220;I can taste blood in my mouth,&#8221; said a translation of the quotes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please pay attention to your health, that is the most important,&#8221; posted numerous fans of the group.</p>

<p>Zhang Yunlei, one of China&#8217;s most popular crosstalk comedians, found himself at the center of a huge controversy after he mocked 48-year-old Peking Opera performer Zhang Huoding during one of his performances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his routine, the comedian joked that he had once showered together with Zhang &#8211; a joke that was seen by many as degrading the female opera singer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some crosstalk performers have repeatedly lost their moral integrity and their basic respect for the art of crosstalk,&#8221; the Chinese Ballad Singers Association said in a statement that netizens have seen as taking a swing at the comedian.</p>
<p>Zhang has previously been criticized for jokes about the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan Province and WWII &#8220;comfort women.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>International cooperation is crucial to helping safeguard and develop the Historic Site of Angkor, a world heritage site in Cambodia&#8217;s northwestern Siem Reap Province, a spokesman for the Angkor protection authority said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Angkor, the most popular tourist destination in Cambodia, was inscribed on UNESCO&#8217;s World Heritage List in 1992.</p>
<p>A year later, the International Coordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC-Angkor) was established to coordinate all foreign assistance for preserving and developing the ancient site.</p>
<p>Long Kosal, spokesman for Apsara National Authority, the management authority responsible for protecting and preserving Angkor, said ICC-Angkor is a multilateral platform, where decisions relating to the safeguarding and development of Angkor are made.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has always been in the form of multilateral cooperation in the sense of its decision-making process and bilateral at the implementation stage,&#8221; Kosal told the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is so because any project or activity to be carried out in Angkor will go through vigorous analysis and debate by all members of the ICC, including the co-chair countries, UNESCO and Apsara National Authority,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Kosal said that through multilateral cooperation under ICC-Angkor, tremendous achievements have been made in protecting and preserving Angkor over the past years.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this international mechanism, Angkor is not only totally safe&#8230; but has also become a highly attractive destination in the world,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;To this end, Angkor contributes greatly to rejuvenating the country&#8217;s economic and social development.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesman added that the 26th plenary session of ICC-Angkor, to be held on December 10-11 in Siem Reap Province, will formulate action plans for the new year following progress already made.</p>
<p>&#8220;The experts will be visiting all working sites to check and monitor the previous or on-going implementations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, the meeting will decide certain actions or new projects to be taken in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kosal said that China has been playing an active role in protecting and preserving Angkor, as it has been helping restore ruined temples in the complex of Angkor since the 1990s.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has long played an important role in helping Cambodia preserve her cultural heritages,&#8221; the spokesman noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for Angkor, we had two important temples restored by the Chinese team, and another new project is fast approaching. Hence, this continued effort amplifies great Chinese commitment toward the preservation and restoration of temples in Angkor,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Chinese cultural relic experts restored the Chau Say Tevoda Temple in 2008 and the Ta Keo Temple in 2018, with the latter starting in late 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very satisfied with the results of the restoration work,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese experts&#8217; skills and expertise in restoring the two temples are very high, and the results of their work have been highly evaluated by ICC-Angkor&#8217;s technical committee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kosal added that projects conducted by the Chinese team and other teams such as those from France, India, Japan and Germany, are very important to restoring ruined temples to their original state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese President Xi Jinping once said that &#8216;a civilization carries on its back the soul of a country or nation. It needs to be passed on from one generation to the next. Yet more importantly, it needs to keep pace with the times and innovate with courage,'&#8221; said Kosal.</p>
<p>Cambodia has three world heritage sites, namely Angkor, the Temple of Preah Vihear, and the Temple Zone of Sambor Prei Kuk, Archaeological Site of Ancient Ishanapura. China has been involved in the restoration of ruined temples at two of these sites.</p>
<p>The spokesman added that in 2018, Cambodia entrusted China to restore the Royal Palace of Angkor Thom in the Angkor complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;We entrusted China to restore the former Royal Palace of Angkor Thom because we recognized China&#8217;s role, effort, commitment and attention to safeguarding and developing Angkor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Azedine Beschaouch, scientific secretary for ICC-Angkor, said cultural ties between Cambodia and China are profound and have lasted for centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s contribution to restoring those ruined temples has not only ensured the safeguarding of the Angkor monuments, but also has helped attract more and more Chinese tourists to the site,&#8221; Beschaouch told Xinhua.</p>
<p>Angkor attracted 1.8 million foreign visitors in the first 10 months this year, including some 750,000 Chinese tourists, earning a gross revenue of $80.7 million from ticket sales, according to a government report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fleet of polished 1950&#8217;s roadsters and tailfin cars stole the show here on Sunday in celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of the city&#8217;s founding.</p>
<p>Members of the local vintage car club &#8220;With Cuban Style&#8221; drove 52 of their shiniest classic cars, including Chevrolets, Buicks, Fords, Studebakers and Cadillacs, through city streets as part of a regularity rally.</p>
<p>Jose Festari, 77, is the proud owner of a 1930s Ford Deluxe Roadster that featured in the rally.</p>
<p>A retired army officer, Festari looks after his automobile as if it were the love of his life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time and attention he has invested in the roadster has paid off, as these days he can rent it out for photo and video shoots.</p>
<p>Some 98 percent of his vehicle is made up of original parts that rolled off the assembly line of the Henry Ford factory in the US state of Michigan, he said.</p>
<p>Festari bought the car more than 20 years ago from another Cuban who was about to emigrate to Spain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had to sell his previous vehicle, a Mercedes 190 SL, to buy the Ford convertible, and gradually collected the original spare parts he needed to make the car truly authentic.</p>
<p>Alberto Gutierrez, who founded the club in October 2003, told the Xinhua News Agency that the vintage cars are a perfect fit for the Cuban capital that turned 500 in November, and the rally is a way to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regularity rallies are held in many parts of the world, especially in Europe, and we wanted to bring that style of competition to our country,&#8221; said Gutierrez, who is also the director of a paced race, which covers a 45-kilometer route through the city&#8217;s main neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our 15th [rally] already. A lot of people like this kind of competition and it has many fans,&#8221; said Gutierrez.</p>
<p>The vintage car club was founded in the parking lot of the Tropicana cabaret, which serves as an informal meeting place for the group, whose members together have more than 100 cars and motorcycles.</p>
<p>The club&#8217;s name &#8211; &#8220;With Cuban Style&#8221; &#8211; was given in reference to the local invention of replacement parts when old vehicles had mechanical failures and original spare parts were hard to come by due to the US trade embargo.</p>
<p>Havana&#8217;s classic automobiles are not just a unique attraction for the city, but also a tribute to the resourcefulness of Cubans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
