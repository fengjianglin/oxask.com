<p>Chief Executive of China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said Tuesday that more relief measures will be rolled out soon to help businesses and residents weather out economic hardship, following three rounds of such policies adopted during the past months.</p>
<p>As multiple data have revealed a grim economic circumstance, the HKSAR government will closely monitor the situation and carry out new relief measures, Lam told a press conference.</p>
<p>The HKSAR government has allocated about 20 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.55 billion U.S. dollars) in total since August in hopes of reviving an economy that has stepped into a technical recession.</p>

<p>GLOOMY ECONOMY</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost millions of Hong Kong dollars each month recently,&#8221; a server of a spicy crab restaurant in Causeway Bay said. At lunchtime, there were only a few diners at the restaurant that just opened in July.</p>
<p>Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said Hong Kong&#8217;s catering sector is expected to lose 17 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.17 billion U.S. dollars) from June and December, and about 400 restaurants have closed down so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;The official unemployment rate in Hong Kong&#8217;s catering industry in October is 6.1 percent, but my estimate is 7 to 7.5 percent, that is nearly 22,000 people lost their jobs in October,&#8221; he said. He was afraid that over 1,000 more restaurants may not survive the current crisis by February.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business sentiment has turned pessimistic, weighed down by external uncertainties and local violent incidents that have dragged on for months,&#8221; HKSAR government Financial Secretary Paul Chan said at a meeting of the Legislative Council, stressing that industries from tourism to catering are struggling in the bleak winter.</p>
<p>Retail sales decreased 24.3 percent from a year ago in October, the largest decline for a single month on record. Visitors to Hong Kong tumbled 43.7 percent year on year in October.</p>
<p>The economy dropped 2.9 percent in the third quarter, sharply down from the 0.4-percent growth in the second quarter.</p>

<p>PESSIMISTIC SENTIMENT</p>
<p>&#8220;Three months? Half a year? I have no idea when my life can be normal again,&#8221; a tour guide surnamed Wan said. The veteran tour guide who had gone through hard days of the financial crisis and the SARS outbreak felt that he could not make it this time.</p>
<p>With no tour groups to receive since June, Wan has started to take part-time jobs at metro stations and restaurants.</p>
<p>Tourism was one of the hardest-hit sectors by the months-long violence. &#8220;There is no sign of a recovery in December, instead a 30-to-40 percent drop in the tourism revenue will be likely,&#8221; a lawmaker and tourism industry insider Yiu Si-wing said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the situation settles down a little bit, the sector is unlikely to return to the previous level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HKSAR government has cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2019 to a negative 1.3 percent, which will be the region&#8217;s first annual decline since 2009. The unemployment rate, which has already spiked to 3.1 percent during the August-October period, will likely rise further in the coming months.</p>
<p>Hong Kong will likely register its first budget deficit in 15 years for the current fiscal year ending on March 31, as the economy has slipped into a technical recession amid the prolonged social unrest, Paul Chan said.</p>
<p>Despite possible fiscal deficits in the coming one or two years, it is high time the HKSAR government made full use of the wealth and surplus accumulated in the past to relieve the burden on residents, Carrie Lam said.</p>

<p>VIOLENCE MUST END</p>
<p>Lam said she hopes violent incidents will stop as soon as possible to give the economy a chance to recover.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that relief measures can only help businesses keep afloat for a longer time and it is the end of violence and the restoring of peace that will allow people to return to their normal lives and push the economy back on track.</p>
<p>Chan also expressed concerns about looming challenges to the economy in the next year and even bigger impacts on people&#8217;s livelihood, as well as the dented confidence of international investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need concerted efforts from all sectors of the community to stop violence and chaos and facilitate the economic recovery,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;So that order can be restored, residents can live a peaceful life again and businesses can operate normally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiple districts in Kowloon descended again into chaos over the weekend as rioters hijacked public events and resorted to destructive acts like building barricades on roads, setting fires and vandalizing public facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the US enacted two laws that could be potentially punishing for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy, there is no clear sign that its close allies &#8211; including the UK, Canada, Germany and Australia &#8211; will follow suit immediately, despite rising calls for them to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these countries, the decision presents a huge dilemma as they consider their massive economic interests in the global finance and commerce hub and the potentially damaging countermeasures any such attempt could prompt from Beijing, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a fact that these Western countries cannot ignore: &#8220;Sanctioning Hong Kong is looking for trouble,&#8221; Liang Haiming, a Hong Kong-based economist, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Take the EU as an example. Hong Kong was the bloc&#8217;s 20th largest trading partner in 2018 and its eighth-largest partner in Asia, with a total trade volume reaching 46.5 billion euros ($51.5 billion), according to EU data. Additionally, the EU has over 2,200 companies operating in the city.</p>
<p>Germany, Australia and Canada also have huge economic interests in Hong Kong, which serves as a hub for trade in and out of the Chinese mainland. In 2018, trade between Hong Kong and Germany reached 14.12 billion euros, while trade between Hong Kong and Australia stood at $6.9 billion, according to official Hong Kong data. Trade between Canada and Hong Kong reached $3.76 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>Though officials in Germany, the UK, Australia and Canada have long sided with the radical protesters in Hong Kong, thus far they have not publicly announced any concrete actions to follow the US&#8217; suit, despite rising domestic calls for them to do so.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, Foreign Office ministers have threatened to use sanctions laws against individuals in Hong Kong that they deem guilty of human rights abuses, the Guardian reported on November 13. In Canada, there are also calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to adopt US-style laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything, these countries &#8220;should be chastising the US for hurting their interests,&#8221; Liang said, noting that the US move is &#8220;an unjust cause that lacks popular support.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the two new US laws requires the US government, specifically the US State Department, to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong&#8217;s human rights and democracy status, which could then lead to a change in its special trade arrangement with the US. The move has drawn fury from officials in Beijing, who called it blatant interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs and a punishment for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>China on Monday announced countermeasures against the US&#8217; move, including the suspension of US warship and aircraft visits to the city and the sanctioning of multiple US-based non-governmental organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its allies follow in the US&#8217; footsteps, they will &#8220;also face the ire of China&#8217;s central government,&#8221; Liang said.</p>

<p>China on Tuesday extended praise to several European countries for ramping up efforts to establish a barter mechanism that is designed to circumvent the US&#8217; unilateral sanctions on Iran, billing the move as conducive to break US financial hegemony.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry also expressed hope that the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a European initiative to facilitate non-dollar transactions with Iran, will include more countries beyond the EU.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome the decision of the six European countries and support continuous progress of the INSTEX,&#8221; Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, told a briefing on Tuesday, referring to the six European countries that have so far jumped on board on the initiative.</p>
<p>On Monday, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway announced that they would join France, Germany and the UK in the INSTEX, boosting the status of the mechanism and dealing a blow to the US, which unilaterally withdrew from an agreement reached by major countries, including China, and reinstated sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>Hua said that the EU&#8217;s move is an effort to safeguard the Iran nuclear agreement, support multilateralism and preserve a rules-based global order. This is conducive to breaking the US&#8217; financial hegemony, Hua said.</p>
<p>As the US continues to crack down on Chinese companies based on its domestic laws and sanctions, China has been pushing for alternatives to the current US dollar-dominated global clearing system for transactions, including setting up non-dollar settlement systems with trading partners.</p>
<p>On November 19, China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding to boost the use of the yuan and the ruble in bilateral and international trade. Facing US sanctions, Venezuela has also offered to pay suppliers and contractors in yuan for oil transactions, Reuters reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a clear sign of China&#8217;s interest in the INSTEX, the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China was expecting that the &#8220;mechanism will soon be expanded to have more operational scope and be open to third-party countries.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Macao Special Administrative Region is set to re-anchor its economy to the financial sector as the casino capital of the world eyes closer ties with the Chinese mainland to rev up its economic diversification away from the gambling industry, a veteran market watcher said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city, scheduled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland later this month, is embracing new opportunities to diversify its economy toward the financial sector, Ding Meng, a senior strategist at Bank of China&#8217;s Macao branch, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two areas of focus for the central government to consider when it comes to policies to boost the role of the financial sector in Macao&#8217;s economy, Ding said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, mainland companies can be encouraged to issue bonds in Macao with the government offering interest subsidies and simplifying issuance procedures, he suggested, noting that unlike Hong Kong, the banking sector in Macao is composed mostly of mainland banks, meaning the risks could be easily controlled.</p>
<p>For another, Hengqin, a free trade zone in Zhuhai, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province can be tapped to spur the financial sector in Macao. Hengqin, increasingly a magnet for financial businesses, is an ideal location for domestic businesses to set up fund pools and fundraising hubs, thereby benefiting the adjacent city of Macao, he went on to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s flagging gambling sector, still a hefty contributor to local finances, apparently puts the local economy under pressure to pursue green shoots of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s gross gaming revenue shrank 8.5 percent year-on-year in November, worsening from a contraction of 3.2 percent in the prior month, according to data from the city&#8217;s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.</p>
<p>In the first 11 months of the year, the city&#8217;s gross gaming revenue fell 2.4 percent on a yearly basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s economy contracted 4.5 percent year-on-year in real terms in the third quarter, official data showed. This marked the third consecutive quarterly contraction. In the first nine months, the local economy fell by 3.5 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The financial sector is an important part of Macao&#8217;s economy, albeit trailing the gambling and property sectors in terms of contribution to GDP, which offers a viable alternative to underpin the city&#8217;s economic growth, according to Ding.</p>
<p>He cited the city&#8217;s legal environment, its alignment with the international markets, its offshore market, and Macao&#8217;s proximity to Hong Kong, one of the global key financial hubs.</p>

<p>The US purchasing manufacturer&#8217;s index (PMI) declined in November and came in below expectations, while the PMIs of China and the EU rose. Analysts said the figures show that the US is lying in the bed it made when it comes to the impact on trade wars on manufacturing.</p>
<p>The US PMI fell for the fourth consecutive month to 48.1, from 48.3 in October and below market expectations of 49.4, the Institute for Supply Management announced on Monday.</p>
<p>A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below 50 falls into the contraction range.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US is suffering from the trade wars, not only with China, but with the rest of the world,&#8221; Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the backdrop of the persistent trade war and an unsustainable fiscal deficit, a decline in US manufacturing is inevitable,&#8221; Tian noted.</p>
<p>The deficit for fiscal 2019 was $984 billion, hitting a seven-year high, according to the US Treasury in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies are pessimistic about future growth demand in the US, especially given the significant destocking in US manufacturing,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p>While US manufacturing keeps dropping, China&#8217;s PMI rose to its highest level in almost three years, with a reading of 51.8 in November, according to the Caixin manufacturing PMI on Monday.</p>

<p>Zhou Xuezhi, a research fellow at the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that China&#8217;s PMI is rising, indicating that business investment continues to improve and confidence is returning.</p>
<p>Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times that US is &#8220;naive and stupid&#8221; in aiming to revitalize its manufacturing industry by adopting the &#8220;America First&#8221; doctrine.</p>
<p>&#8220;By starting the trade wars with the world, the US hopes to win market space. However, if it breaks away from the overall structure of the international division of labor, and looks to develop itself by trade protectionism, it will end up locking itself on an island,&#8221; Bai said. By doing so, US manufacturers cannot take advantage of global resources.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump&#8217;s tweet on Tuesday reinstated tariffs on Brazilian and Argentine steel and aluminum. Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced that he had proposed action to impose additional tariffs on some $2.4 billion worth of French products, as a retaliation for France&#8217;s digital services tax.</p>
<p>Bai suggested the US should combine its advanced technology with other countries&#8217; advantages in manufacturing to develop together, giving the example of Germany&#8217;s precision instrument manufacturing and China&#8217;s large-scale processing capacity as &#8220;the world&#8217;s factory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cooperation between China and Europe may have to be strengthened. In the future, there may be a process under which intra-Eurasian trade will continue to increase while trade with the US will decline or even worse, decouple,&#8221; Tian added.</p>
<p>Tian also predicted that the GDP growth of the US in the fourth quarter will very likely be less than 2 percent, given the trade war background and a consistent decline in the PMI. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada Goose, Hatley, Factors Group &#8211; what do those names have in common? They are all Canadian companies that increased investment in China recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those companies&#8217; moves show a warming-up trend in bilateral economic relations between China and Canada, as Canadian enterprises value business opportunities in the Chinese market and won&#8217;t stop their investment plans because of external pressure, experts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada Goose, for example, made a choice to continue exploring the Chinese mainland market despite business setbacks arising from the two countries&#8217; cooling relations. In November, the Canadian jacket maker opened a new store in a Shanghai luxury shopping mall, its fifth store in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new store got a positive response from local customers. At around noon on Tuesday, customers had to wait in queue for half an hour to enter the shop. The waiting time could be over one hour during weekends, one shop assistant told the Global Times at the entrance of the store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some customers have traveled from other regions like Suzhou and Anhui, just to shop at the store,&#8221; the shopping assistant said, adding that some designs had already sold out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One customer, wearing a dark green Canada Goose jacket, told the Global Times that she passed by the store and dropped in to see if she could get something for her relatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A year ago, Canada Goose was caught in the crossfire following Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou&#8217;s arrest in Vancouver. The company experienced a steep share price drop for nearly one week, but it didn&#8217;t halt steps to penetrate the Chinese market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada Goose had planned to arrange a group interview with one of the company&#8217;s senior executives but later cancelled it. The company didn&#8217;t reveal its financial data in China when contacted by the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of Canadian companies have made similar moves to increase their presence in China. Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons opened a store in Shanghai in February, its first store in the country. Children&#8217;s clothing maker Hatley and healthy food producer Factors Group signed deals during the recent China International Import Expo to bring more products to China, according to canadainternational.gc.ca.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A senior executive from the Canada-based telecom giant Ice Wireless, which is working with Huawei, said the company could deploy Huawei&#8217;s 5G &#8220;in the hinterland in short order,&#8221; according to a report of the Post Millennial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are signs that testify to the warming trade and investment relations between China and Canada, which had been affected by a bilateral chill over the Huawei issue, Zhou Rong, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s trade with Canada rose by 3.4 percent on a yearly basis to $54.4 billion in the first 10 months, customs data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese market is just too important for Canadian businesses to ignore. Being a country with vast land but relatively a small population, Canada needs a market to consume its products. Where else can Canada find such a market as China that has a large number of customers capable of spending?&#8221; Zhou said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their need to cling to the Chinese markets would turn more urgent as Canada&#8217;s economy slows down in recent months, said Zhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Zhou said it might take time for the Canadian government to further mend political relations with China. &#8220;But one thing is for sure, Canadian companies will increase investment in the Chinese market regardless of political friction,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foreign investors have been reinforcing their purchasing power on Chinese bonds, official data showed. Analysts give credit to the reform and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market, and&nbsp;bigger interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investors jumped at Chinese bonds in the first 11 months of the year, with cumulative net purchases reaching 970.2 billion yuan ($137.77 billion), data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) showed on Monday. That meant the total cumulative net purchases from foreign investors have approached nearly 1 trillion yuan in the first 11 months.</p>
<p>In November, transactions by foreign investors came to a total of 567 billion yuan, up 5 percent month-on-month and 127 percent year-on-year, CFETS said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November was the 12th consecutive month that foreign investors snapped up Chinese bonds. It is also notable that the number of foreign investors new to China&#8217;s interbank bonds market in the first 11 months &#8211; 1,331 &#8211; has surpassed the total number in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market have enabled more foreign investors to enter China&#8217;s financial market, as reflected by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and the country&#8217;s great efforts to build the yuan&#8217;s offshore financial market, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the risk of investing overseas is increasing with a declining yield rate under the pressure of the global economic downturn … but China&#8217;s bonds have relatively good returns on investment,&#8221; Liu noted, adding that foreigners&#8217; increasing purchasing power shows their confidence in China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 marks the lowest-performing year for global bond yields, but the interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds have surged to an historical peak, the China Securities Journal reported on Tuesday. Statistics showed the 10-year bond spreads between China and the US have surpassed 140 basis points, which is relatively high historically, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recorded around 131.5 billion yuan (about 18.7 billion U.S. dollars) in imports and exports in the first 10 months of this year, up 28 percent year on year, local authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The autonomous region&#8217;s export volume during the period was 100.2 billion yuan, up 19.9 percent, while its import volume soared to 31.3 billion yuan, up 63.1 percent, according to the customs authorities of Urumqi, the regional capital.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months, Kazakhstan topped the list of Xinjiang&#8217;s major trade partners, with trade volume between the two growing by 28.2 percent to 60.2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Xinjiang&#8217;s trade with Kyrgyzstan, Australia, Pakistan, Britain, Argentina and Vietnam also showed fast growth, according to the local customs authorities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China&#8217;s central bank continued to pump cash into the money market in November to meet liquidity demand from financial institutions.</p>
<p>A total of 600 billion yuan (about 85.4 billion U.S. dollars) was injected into the market via the medium-term lending facility (MLF) last month to maintain liquidity in the banking system at a reasonably sufficient level, according to the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC).</p>
<p>The funds will mature in one year at an interest rate of 3.25 percent.</p>
<p>Total outstanding MLF loans reached 3.56 trillion yuan as of the end of November.</p>
<p>The MLF tool was introduced in 2014 to help commercial and policy banks maintain liquidity by allowing them to borrow from the central bank using securities as collateral.</p>
<p>In November, the PBOC also injected 4.8 billion yuan of funds through pledged supplementary lending to the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Agricultural Development Bank of China.</p>
<p>Another 62.25 billion yuan was lent to financial institutions through the standing lending facility to meet provisional liquidity demand.</p>
<p>The central bank has adopted open market operations more frequently to manage liquidity in a more flexible and targeted manner.</p>
<p>China has pledged to keep its prudent monetary policy &#8220;neither too tight nor too loose&#8221; while maintaining market liquidity at a reasonably ample level in 2019.</p>
