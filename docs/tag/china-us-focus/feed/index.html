<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chinese and US trade officials make attempt at striking a trade deal to defuse an increasingly bruising trade war that has rattled global markets and presented mounting challenges to both economies. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Are China and the US on the way to reaching the first stage of a trade agreement? How far away is the realization of this goal? For some time, both sides have been sending out messages. The US actually contributes more information, but these messages often cancel each other out. It is still uncertain when a consensus can be reached for a phase one trade deal.</p>
<p>More importantly, why is it necessary to have such an agreement? Is it worth it for both sides to work toward that goal?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, achieving a phase one agreement would signal that the China-US trade war has reached a mutually recognizable turning point. According to the core concerns of both Beijing and Washington, China wants tariffs to be rolled back in the phase one trade agreement, which would be the first step to cancel the tariffs that have been imposed by the two sides since last year. For its part, the US wants China to buy a large amount of American agricultural products right now. If a deal is reached, both countries can benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these economic interests alone are not enough to motivate the two sides to reach an significant result. China and the US can both bear the current losses, and potential future economic losses will be far from fatal for either country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US government believes that China&#8217;s economy is being battered, which is totally self-deceiving propaganda. The trade war has caused China some difficulties, but these difficulties will never lead to significant political compromises by Beijing. China&#8217;s economy is basically under smooth operation, and Chinese society has adapted to cope with the trade war.</p>
<p>The significance of a phase one trade deal will be more political than economic. It will be extensively regarded as a political gesture. China and the US are willing and able to control their huge differences through consultation and negotiation, so that a chain reaction won&#8217;t occur and shake the current world order.</p>
<p>The biggest confusion about this issue from the rest of the world lies in the blurry prospect of China-US relations. From US Vice President Mike Pence to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, many American senior officials express obvious hostility against China, while US President Donald Trump sometimes makes some kind statements to please China. Nevertheless, they are obviously just playing &#8220;good cop, bad cop.&#8221; Many think some American political elites want to help bring about a &#8220;Cold War&#8221; with China. But since that is apparently unpopular in the 21st century, do they really have support in the US?</p>
<p>Trump has never abandoned negotiation with China and the US government has made some practical efforts toward reaching an agreement. Based on this, it appears that radical policies don&#8217;t have uniform support in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington has the motivation to meet Beijing halfway as China seeks to expand its opening-up. American views of China will be tested when Trump runs for re-election next year. That&#8217;s when it will be determined what is most popular among Americans &#8211; the motivation to cooperate with China or the impulse to decouple the two countries&#8217; economies.</p>
<p>Hopefully, a phase one trade agreement can be reached. That would be a mutual success and a tribute to both sides&#8217; rationality. On the contrary, if the other way of thinking dominates China-US relations, both countries will waste time on a dead-end road.</p>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />The US economy expanded &#8220;modestly&#8221; from October through mid-November while retailers reported higher costs resulting from tariffs, according to a Federal Reserve survey released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Districts reported stable to moderately growing consumer spending, and increases in auto sales and tourism were seen across several Districts,&#8221; said the Fed in its latest survey on economic conditions, known as the Beige Book, based on information collected from its 12 regional reserve banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;In manufacturing, more Districts reported an expansion in the current period than the previous one, though the majority continued to experience no growth,&#8221; the survey said.</p>
<p>The survey also showed that retailers reported higher costs from tariffs and firms generally expected higher prices going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms&#8217; ability to raise prices to cover higher costs remained limited, though a few Districts noted that companies affected by the tariffs were more inclined to pass on cost increases,&#8221; the survey said.</p>
<p>In the Cleveland Fed district, a clothing retailer reduced the use of price discounting to offset higher costs resulting from tariffs. By contrast, a food retailer said that while tariffs had increased costs, the company &#8220;cannot raise prices on a whim&#8221; because of fierce competition.</p>
<p>Business contacts in the Chicago Fed district reported that retail prices &#8220;increased modestly&#8221; and they expected prices to &#8220;rise at a somewhat faster pace&#8221; over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;One contact said that food, home goods, and apparel retailers were struggling to pass on higher costs; in contrast, another contact noted that retailers continued to raise prices to reflect higher potential and realized tariffs,&#8221; the survey showed.</p>
<p>In the Richmond Fed district, several retailers also reported that tariffs were raising costs and hurting profit margins, according to the survey.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers and businesses paid an additional 38 billion US dollars in tariffs from February 2018 to September 2019 due to US-China trade disputes, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a US anti-tariff advocacy group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Economists, analysts and experts across the board agree the tariffs are hurting the economy,&#8221; Jonathan Gold, a spokesperson for Americans for Free Trade, which is a coalition of US businesses, trade organizations and workers against tariffs, said in a statement earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;The manufacturing industry slowed for the third month in a row in October; farm bankruptcies are on the rise; and business investment contracted for the second quarter in a row,&#8221; Gold said, urging the US government to reach a final deal with China that &#8220;removes all tariffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the long-lasting China-US trade war has weighed on Chinese exporters over the past year, it turns out the country&#8217;s export-oriented private sector has grown even stronger as tax breaks from the central government and a shift in overseas markets gradually take effect.</p>
<p>Exporters in Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, also known as the shop front of the world&#8217;s factory, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the trade war is no longer a headache for their businesses and they have even seen steady growth in overseas sales and profits recently.</p>
<p>Yang Zhiwei, general manager of Yibing Import and Export Co, which focuses on decorations and accessories, said his businesses saw limited impact from trade war this year, and his company&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> orders have even increased compared with 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders for<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1032688.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentine&#8217;s Day</a> have been coming in since October,&#8221; Yang said.</p>
<p>Yang expected the company&#8217;s sales in 2019 could reach 10 million yuan ($1.42 million), up 400 percent from last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Yang mentioned the adjustments he made due to the trade war. Now, half of his customers are in Europe, which has overtaken North America as his company&#8217;s largest market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yang&#8217;s turn to Europe also applies to his counterparts in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. From January to October this year, trade between Guangdong and the US dropped 6 percent year-on-year, while trade with the EU was up 10.9 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The China-US trade war has led some companies to increase efforts to develop markets in European countries and those that are involved in the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative,&#8221; said Sun Yijiu, CEO of Beijing Wangju Co, which designs websites for e-commerce companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they were expanding and diversifying long before the trade war. So the impact of the trade war on our customers is very limited,&#8221; said Sun.</p>
<p>The company is also getting more customers because of the better-than-expected foreign trade situation. Sun said that he has observed an increasing number of companies that want to turn to overseas business over the past two years.</p>
<p>Cross-border e-commerce trade reached 61.28 billion yuan, up 17.4 percent on a yearly basis, during the first 10 months this year in Yiwu, government data showed.</p>
<p>Latest figures also showed that China&#8217;s small private-sector companies have become an economic stabilizer of the country. From January to October this year, private companies&#8217; profits grew 5.3 percent year-on-year, and small companies&#8217; profits grew 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Key government support</p>
<p>Yiwu exporters said the central government&#8217;s policy of waiving business taxes on micro-sized and small businesses is one of the major reasons that such enterprises could grow and prosper, posting steady profit growth amid external uncertainties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growing competitiveness of made-in-China products also makes it tough for foreign customers to leave, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government gives small e-commerce businesses like us a zero-tax policy. Our company spent all of the money that would have gone to taxes on research and development (R&amp;D) last year,&#8221; said Jin Hongbin, the general manager of Yiwu Heyang Plastics Co.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jin told the Global Times on Wednesday that the company could be able to invest about 16 percent of its sales revenue on R&amp;D to improve its innovation and competitiveness.</p>
<p>China has cut taxes for small and micro-sized businesses since the beginning of the year, with the goal of saving them a total of 200 billion yuan annually for three years.</p>
<p>Another Yiwu merchant who has benefited from the tax policy, Mao Xiaochun, product purchasing manager of Yiwu Juding Costume, said that due to the tax cut, sales are expected to reach 250 million yuan this year, up 25 percent on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margins are down a little bit, but there&#8217;s less tax to be paid and overall sales are up. Thus, our profits increase continuously,&#8221; Mao said.</p>
<p>The problem is that talents in Yiwu now could not support our growth, as they prefer large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, Jin said.</p>
