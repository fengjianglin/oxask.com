<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chiang Mai&#8217;s hotel room occupancy is likely to drop to about 60 percent throughout this year, according to a hotelier of Thailand&#8217;s northern tourist province.</p>
<p>La-iad Bungsrithong, chief of the Thai Hotels Association&#8217;s Northern Chapter, said on Monday that the room occupancy in all districts of Chiang Mai is believed to drop to as low as 60 percent throughout this year, compared to 75 percent last year.</p>
<p>The northern tourist province currently has an estimated 60,000 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Some 8.08 million tourists have visited Chiang Mai during this year&#8217;s first 10 months, accounting for a 1.14 percent drop from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chiang Mai&#8217;s decreased occupancy is expected to fairly rebound during the first quarter of 2020, given MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events to be organized for government personnel as well as corporate employees, La-iad said.</p>
<p>The sluggish tourism of Chiang Mai is largely attributed to the strengthened baht, prompting foreign tourists to go elsewhere, she said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A sale sign stands out side a store in the Central district of Hong Kong Photo: VCG</p>
<p>After the US enacted two laws that could be potentially punishing for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy, there is no clear sign that its close allies &#8211; including the UK, Canada, Germany and Australia &#8211; will follow suit immediately, despite rising calls for them to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these countries, the decision presents a huge dilemma as they consider their massive economic interests in the global finance and commerce hub and the potentially damaging countermeasures any such attempt could prompt from Beijing, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a fact that these Western countries cannot ignore: &#8220;Sanctioning Hong Kong is looking for trouble,&#8221; Liang Haiming, a Hong Kong-based economist, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Take the EU as an example. Hong Kong was the bloc&#8217;s 20th largest trading partner in 2018 and its eighth-largest partner in Asia, with a total trade volume reaching 46.5 billion euros ($51.5 billion), according to EU data. Additionally, the EU has over 2,200 companies operating in the city.</p>
<p>Germany, Australia and Canada also have huge economic interests in Hong Kong, which serves as a hub for trade in and out of the Chinese mainland. In 2018, trade between Hong Kong and Germany reached 14.12 billion euros, while trade between Hong Kong and Australia stood at $6.9 billion, according to official Hong Kong data. Trade between Canada and Hong Kong reached $3.76 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>Though officials in Germany, the UK, Australia and Canada have long sided with the radical protesters in Hong Kong, thus far they have not publicly announced any concrete actions to follow the US&#8217; suit, despite rising domestic calls for them to do so.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, Foreign Office ministers have threatened to use sanctions laws against individuals in Hong Kong that they deem guilty of human rights abuses, the Guardian reported on November 13. In Canada, there are also calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to adopt US-style laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything, these countries &#8220;should be chastising the US for hurting their interests,&#8221; Liang said, noting that the US move is &#8220;an unjust cause that lacks popular support.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the two new US laws requires the US government, specifically the US State Department, to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong&#8217;s human rights and democracy status, which could then lead to a change in its special trade arrangement with the US. The move has drawn fury from officials in Beijing, who called it blatant interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs and a punishment for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>China on Monday announced countermeasures against the US&#8217; move, including the suspension of US warship and aircraft visits to the city and the sanctioning of multiple US-based non-governmental organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its allies follow in the US&#8217; footsteps, they will &#8220;also face the ire of China&#8217;s central government,&#8221; Liang said.</p>

<p>While black-clad protesters in Hong Kong waved American flags and chanted &#8220;President Donald Trump, let&#8217;s make Hong Kong great again,&#8221; the city has been plunging into its deepest recession in a decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said on Tuesday that officials would soon roll out a fourth round of relief measures as the city now faces a &#8220;severe economic situation.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She revealed that unemployment was expected to further rise from the current 3.1 percent.</p>
<p>The city recorded its biggest retail slump in October, a drop of 24.3 percent year-on-year, and the HKSAR government is poised to experience the first budget deficit in 15 years in the fiscal year that ends in March 2020.Some raised questions about whether protesters expect a recession, and several prominent economists predicted that Asia&#8217;s financial hub is quite likely to see an economic contraction in 2020, which will take a toll on financial market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s economy is expected to contract 1.3 percent year-on-year in 2019 due to external pressure and social unrest, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po told the Panel on Financial Affairs of Legislative Council on Monday. A sharp economic deterioration and recession, in addition to months of violence, has weakened investment confidence, affected local consumption and will further weigh on people&#8217;s livelihoods, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tension returned to Hong Kong&#8217;s streets during the weekend as clashes between rioters and police broke out in different districts such as Mong Kok and Whampoa. Rioters trashed stores and beat up innocent residents who disagreed with their behavior. There were major clashes barely after a week-long &#8220;truce,&#8221; especially during the District Council election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some local residents and tourists from the Chinese mainland said they are still worried about their personal safety when they walk the streets and local businesses, which have been suffering amid months of social unrest, see a dim future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest figures from the Hong Kong Tourism Board showed that visitor arrivals dropped 43.7 percent year-on-year in October, casting a shadow over industries including retail, services, restaurants, hotels and so on. It was the sharpest drop in a single month since an outbreak of SARS in 2003, and it has turned some tourist sites like Disneyland into &#8220;ghost towns,&#8221; according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong economists worried that months of protests would have long-term consequences on the local economy. The city has also been hit by the China-US trade war because of its role as a major a trading hub. When asked whether Hong Kong risks losing its advantages as a global business and trade window, Francis T. Lui, professor emeritus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, noted that many illegal acts occurred amid political and social unrest and this weighed heavily on Hong Kong&#8217;s business reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A major reason the city became an international business hub was its stable social order and respect for the rule of law, the spirit of contract that business values the most,&#8221; Lui told the Global Times, raising questions about whether the city could maintain those advantages.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Graphics: GT</p>
<p><strong>Financial woes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although anti-government protests have lasted for nearly six months, investors retained confidence in Hong Kong financial markets, which have not become casualties amid the trade war and social unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mainland&#8217;s internet giant Alibaba held an IPO on the Asian region&#8217;s largest financial market, a strong endorsement of the city&#8217;s unshakeable role as global financial hub and the mainland&#8217;s gateway to the global markets, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul Chan said in a blog post on Sunday that though social unrest has hit the local economy hard and seriously affected livelihoods, its consequences on Hong Kong&#8217;s financial market are still limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The financial market has been operating smoothly and orderly,&#8221; Chan said, noting that the Hong Kong stock market entered a new phase of development following Alibaba&#8217;s listing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if violence and chaos continue, the financial market will also be hurt, as the city would lose its attractiveness to both talent and investors, according to analysts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As protests raged in recent weeks, some financial firms urged employees to work at home, as their offices are located in places like Central where regular illegal gatherings were held from time to time. Some banks also shut branches to avoid collateral damage following clashes between police and protests that usually turned violent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the workers in the financial hub, some are expats and mainland employees, and some are considering moving away. Prolonged disruptions to work and daily life also pushed more Hong Kong workers in the sector to think about the possibility of moving abroad, Bloomberg reported in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the near future, financial talent won&#8217;t consider working here in Hong Kong, while more foreign businesses will move away and investment will continue declining. Whether the city could maintain the global financial status, that&#8217;s indeed a worry,&#8221; Chan Kin-por, the chairman of the Legislative Council (LegCo)&#8217;s Finance Committee, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Hong Kong declines, mainland cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen have been accelerating the development of their financial services, which would also narrow the distance between them and Hong Kong,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deep-rooted issues</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observers said that tackling the city&#8217;s economic woes should be preceded by handling social issues such as legislative reform, providing more opportunities for Hong Kong youth and resolving deep-rooted land supply problems, observers said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-03/15682c7c-c3c2-4297-b63b-ebce3464fba8.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Graphics: GT</p>
<p>Considering the city&#8217;s lack of effectiveness in handling riots, Lui suggested that Article 18 of the Basic Law could be an option to end riots and chaos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress decides to declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the HKSAR, which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the HKSAR government, the central government may order the application of relevant national laws in the city, according to the article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young people in a highly politicized society may pay less attention to their own development, as a major focus in the recent District Council election shifted from improving livelihoods to supporting the political agenda of opposition groups. &#8220;Only when deep-rooted issues are handled, will Hong Kong people shift their focus again to an economic recovery,&#8221; LegCo&#8217;s Chan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some local residents who are considering moving out of the city amid social turmoil, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area could offer new opportunities to start businesses, find jobs, find schools for their children and so on. &#8220;This is likely to be a chance for further integration in the area too,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While nuts have long been a favorable snack for festive seasons, China&#8217;s growing demand for nuts has created new opportunities for global suppliers.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2017, China&#8217;s nut industry increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15.7 percent, reaching 121 billion yuan ($17.2 billion) in 2017, according to the China Food Industry Association. Although inclement weather has driven nut prices higher this year, Chinese consumers have not been deterred in their enthusiasm for the snack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the consumption of nuts per capita is still below the global average, experts say the growing demand in quantity and quality is beginning to open up opportunities for the global nuts business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Increased demand</strong></span></p>
<p>Low temperature and rainfall in some nut producing areas in the US caused some apricot flower rots this spring, leading to a significant decline in US almond production. The US Department of Agriculture also lowered its almond output forecast for 2019. According to the department, the projected output in 2019 will be 2.2 million pounds in California, the key almond production region, down 3.5 percent from production last year. The average nut set per tree in 2019 is also down 17.8 percent from 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, prices of almonds in the US rose from $7 per kilogram in June to $7.9 per kilogram in October, a nearly 14 percent increase. The current price is approximately $7.61 per kilogram, an increase of 15 percent, according to a report on toutiao.com, a popular mobile news app in China.</p>
<p>The price increase and additional tariffs on US-imported nuts have put pressure on US nut importers. According to the Hengyi Food Imports and Exports Company based in Shanghai, the prices have increased from 10 to 15 percent depending on variety, but demand continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pistachios, for example can have a price up to 160 yuan per kilogram at its best quality this year, compared to around 120 to 140 yuan last year,&#8221; Hengyi&#8217;s manager surnamed Huang told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sale of nuts in the company did not seem to be affected by the mounting price, Huang said, due to overall increasing demand, as well as the approaching Spring Festival when people consume an increasing amount of nuts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest importer of pistachios, and around 10 percent of the world&#8217;s pistachios are consumed by Chinese buyers, according to a report by the growingproduce.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think as the consumers in China are becoming more demanding of the quality of the nuts and less deterred by its price, the imports are still to increase in near future,&#8221; Huang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Growing potential</strong></span></p>
<p>Behind the rising trend of nuts is the rising health awareness among Chinese consumers who see nuts as a healthy and flavorful snack. Middle class households have especially bought more nuts in recent years fueling unprecedented growth of the nut industry in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meiri Jianguo, a brand under Three Squirrels offering packets of nuts that claim to meet people&#8217;s daily meets for nuts have had their sales soar. According to a report by Three Squirrels, the company had already sold up to 100 million packets of nuts by early May. During this year&#8217;s online shopping festival, Double Eleven, it took less than twenty minutes for the brand to reach a sales volume of 100 million yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three Squirrels&#8217; success is but a small part of the quickly increasing popularity of nuts with Chinese consumers. There is massive room for potential development as consumption per capita is still below the average consumption worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report by the market research website chyxx.com, the consumption of some of the most popular nuts are below global average and drastically lower than some Western countries. In 2017, the average consumption of pistachios recorded in China was only 0.05 kilograms per person, as opposed to around 0.1 kilograms worldwide and about 0.5 kilograms in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the household disposable continues to grow, the demand is also expected to near global average,&#8221; said Zhu Danpeng, a Guangzhou-based food industry analyst. &#8220;Currently most of China&#8217;s imports comes from the US, Australia and some countries in the South America, but it will in the future turn to other key suppliers as its demand grows.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Zhu, the growing nuts market will be the biggest target for global nut suppliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of variety, there is also a huge opportunity. The most consumed nuts in China has traditionally been peanuts, but now people are trying new, more exotic varieties such as Brazil nuts and Macadamia,&#8221; Zhu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another Shanghai-based company SPI West Port Corp, which specializes in selling imported snacks including nuts, said that the company has now started importing nuts from the US and Thailand to meet demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most popular nuts are the honey roasted almonds from the US,&#8221; SPI&#8217;s manager surnamed Yi said, &#8220;but now we are also selecting some brands from Thailand to offer more options to the customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China plans to further boost sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) to push for green and smart growth of the world&#8217;s largest automobile market.</p>
<p>Sales of NEVs are expected to make up about 25 percent of the total new car sales by 2025, according to a draft plan by the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a>.</p>
<p>The sector&#8217;s competitiveness should be enhanced with major technological breakthroughs made in power battery, drive motor, on-board operating system and other fields, the draft plan said.</p>
<p>It requires that starting from 2021, new cars running in the country&#8217;s ecological conservation pilot zones and public areas in regions tasked with fighting air pollution should be NEVs.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s NEV sales posted double-digit growth in the first 10 months of 2019 despite a sluggish automobile market. NEV sales accounted for less than 5 percent of total new car sales during this period.</p>
<p>China also aims to promote ICVs by lifting the share of their sales in total automobile sales to about 30 percent by 2025.</p>
<p>Highly autonomous ICVs might achieve commercial use in certain regions and scenarios, the draft plan said.</p>
<p>The plan came as the government steps up efforts to energize the automobile sector, which lost steam in 2018 with car sales dropping for the first time in over two decades.</p>

<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, a main extract of marijuana which is popular in the European and US markets, is being sold as health products on several Chinese e-commerce platforms including Taobao, jd.com and pinduoduo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In countries where marijuana is legal, the product is listed as a psychoactive drug.</p>
<p>Pinduoduo confirmed with the Global Times on Tuesday that it had removed all CBD products from its platform, but they are still available on Taobao and jd.com.</p>
<p>More than 20 shops appear on Taobao when &#8220;CBD&#8221; is typed into the search bar. Monthly figures differ from 10 to 400 sales for a single product.</p>
<p>A 1-gram bottle of medicine in the shop on Taobao has more than 200 reviews. Many customer reviews show that they have made multiple purchases, with nearly half taking it daily.</p>
<p>The oil&#8217;s product description shows that the addictive ingredient &#8211; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the hallucinogenic component of marijuana &#8211; has been removed.</p>
<p>A customer service representative from a shop on Taobao told the Global Times on Tuesday that the product is safe and has no side effects. He was vague about whether or not this product is a psychotropic drug, or if it needs a doctor&#8217;s advice to be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of customers said that after use, the effect used to treat insomnia is very good,&#8221; said the service representative.</p>
<p>CBD is not a controlled drug in China because of its lack of psychoactive activity, and it is not included in the international drug control convention schedule or the Chinese list of narcotic drugs, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no clear guidance on the sale of CBD in the Chinese market, and experts have warned of the problems caused by a lack of regulations, as CBD products in the market are not guaranteed to be free of THC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drug control laws and regulations shall apply to products containing more than 0.3 percent THC in China, according to Chinese law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;CBD oil that has more than 0.3 percent THC is strictly controlled in accordance with national laws and regulations. Any business that violates the law will be punished by Taobao and reported to law enforcement departments,&#8221; an Alibaba corporate spokesperson told the Global Times.</p>
<p>All the products are imported from the US, where CBD oil is seen as a psychoactive drug, according to their introduction page.</p>
<p>It is not possible to see if the sellers have a license from customs for drug imports and exports. Despite this, import and export licenses for psychotropic drugs should be provided when importing or exporting CBD, in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the General Administration of Customs.</p>

<p>Chinese tech firm ByteDance has begun investing in real-time audio and video streaming through an investment in TrackView, which offers online video-conferencing and other services, dismissing fresh rumors about the company investing in mobile security.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Technology, one of ByteDance’s subsidiaries based in Beijing, has launched an investment in Suzhou TrackView Technology, which is based in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, a spokesperson for ByteDance told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Technology has recently taken a minority stake in Suzhou TrackView Technology, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“The real-time audio and video streaming technology behind TeamLink, the company’s flagship video-conferencing product, is potentially applicable in live-streaming and online education use cases,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Liangzi Yuedong Tech will not participate in the company&#8217;s management or operations, she noted.</p>
<p>As a provider of comprehensive services in social media and new media, it is reasonable for ByteDance to keep expanding its businesses in various sectors, especially to obtain businesses that could form synergistic effects with its current operations, Liu Dingding, an independent analyst in the internet sector, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>ByteDance is an internet technology company founded in Beijing in 2012. It launched popular products including the online content platform Toutiao and the short video platform Tik Tok.</p>
<p>Its products and services are now available in 150 countries and regions, and in 75 languages, according to ByteDance’s website.</p>
<p>It is a common trend for Chinese tech firms to lay out operations or investments in different areas in both domestic and overseas markets, Liu noted.</p>
<p>Chinese tech giant Tencent has launched over 100 investments overseas, and its game business alone covers 200 countries and regions, according to a report by stcn.com on November 26.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Soaring pork prices in China continued to soften last week as the country rolled out multiple measures to stabilize hog production.</p>
<p>From Nov. 25 to 29, the average pork price index in 16 provincial-level regions tracked by the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/20.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Agriculture</a> and Rural Affairs came in at 40.95 yuan (about 5.8 U.S. dollars) per kg, down 3.5 percent week on week.</p>
<p>This is the third consecutive week that the pork price index has retreated since the beginning of November.</p>
<p>The price retreat came as the Chinese government has been taking multi-pronged measures to boost supply, including increasing subsidies to restore hog production, releasing frozen pork reserves and expanding pork imports.</p>
<p>The ministry urged related departments to put great emphasis on restoring hog production and take various measures to ensure pork supply and stabilize pork prices for the coming New Year and Spring Festival holidays.</p>
<p>Prices of pork, a staple meat in China, have been soaring in recent months, mainly affected by African swine fever and cyclical factors.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 3.8 percent year on year last month, mainly driven by soaring pork prices, which rose 101.3 percent year on year in October, contributing nearly two-thirds of the CPI growth.</p>

The China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline was put into operation on Monday. The pipeline is scheduled to provide China with 5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas in 2020 and the amount is expected to increase to 38 billion cubic meters annually from 2024, under a 30-year contract worth 400 billion U.S. dollars signed between the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Russian gas giant Gazprom in May 2014. The cross-border gas pipeline has a 3,000-km section in Russia and a 5,111-km stretch in China. (Xinhua/Wang Jianwei)</p>
