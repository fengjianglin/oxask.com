<p><strong>Happy birthday:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you follow your head rather than your heart today. Now is the time to move cautiously, rather than rushing ahead. Love and commitment will lead to a healthier and happier you. Your lucky numbers: 2, 5, 8, 13, 17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libra (Sep 23 &#8211; Oct 22)</p>
<p>Be careful when it comes to opening your wallet today. You will encounter a financial roadblock if you overspend or get involved in a risky investment. Avoid making bad decisions by maintaining a practical approach to achieving your goals. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scorpio (Oct 23 &#8211; Nov 21)</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to learn a very interesting piece of information that will have a huge impact on your career. Open your heart to romantic possibilities. Sure you may end up getting hurt, but it will definitely be worth it. ✭✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sagittarius (Nov 22 &#8211; Dec 21)</p>
<p>You might find yourself obsessing about getting all of your objectives finished today. While it may be counter-intuitive, you will just end up creating extra work for yourself by committing to such an unrealistic schedule.&nbsp; ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capricorn (Dec 22 &#8211; Jan 19)</p>
<p>It will be very important for you to try and see things from other people&#8217;s perspective today. Even if you can&#8217;t fully understand someone else&#8217;s point of view, compromise is a better choice than just going off on your own. ✭✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aquarius (Jan 20 &#8211; Feb 18)</p>
<p>It will work against you if you take too much time drawing up plans. Instead get the ball rolling as soon as you can and handle things on the fly. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pisces (Feb 19 &#8211; Mar 20)</p>
<p>Impulsive decisions will end up backfiring on you. Bide your time and ease into whatever you decide to do. Yellow will be your lucky color. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aries (Mar 21 &#8211; Apr 19)</p>
<p>Prepare yourself for a busy day today. Make sure you prioritize promises made to others when taking on tasks. Romance is in the stars for you. This is a great day to get out and meet new people. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taurus (Apr 20 &#8211; May 20)</p>
<p>You will have to push yourself to the limit today if you want to stay at the head of the pack. Do not hesitate to reach out to others for help if you start to feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;A financial issue will demand your personal attention. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini (May 21 &#8211; Jun 20)</p>
<p>Go about your day as quietly as possible today. Not everyone will agree with what you want to do or how you do it, so keeping things low-key will help you fly under the radar. If you head out tonight, a romantic encounter will end up putting a smile on your face. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cancer (Jun 21 &#8211; Jul 22)</p>
<p>Your tendency to act spontaneously rather than planning ahead will be exactly what your team needs to succeed today. Your quick thinking and solid instincts will lead the way when others are flailing about. ✭✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leo (Jul 23 &#8211; Aug 22)</p>
<p>Staying positive will enable you to adapt to difficult situations when others would rather give up. Use this as an opportunity to hone your skills so you will be even better prepared for the next challenge. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virgo (Aug 23 &#8211; Sep 22)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you carefully assess any situation before you take action. If you try to proceed too quickly, you are sure to be tripped up by some hidden pitfalls. ✭✭✭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
