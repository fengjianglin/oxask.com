<p>Chinese netizens denounced Zhejiang TV station (Zhejiang STV) for its response to the death of Taiwan island actor Godfrey Gao, and posted 20 questions on the official Sina Weibo account for Gao&#8217;s fans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Weibo account &#8220;Gao Yixiang ba�?posted 20 questions and called on Zhejiang STV to give a public reply to Gao&#8217;s death in the show &#8220;Chase Me&#8221; on November 27.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Gao&#8217;s body was finally returned home six days after the incident. Zhejiang STV only gave an explanation to the public by posting two announcements without an official seal and used money to influence public opinion, divert attention and cover it up. We don&#8217;t want your hypocritical apology. We want the truth!�?the post read. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 20 questions are about the reasons why the TV station did not conduct more timely rescue efforts when Gao fell to the ground and their delayed response to the whole incident.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The hashtag of 20 questions to Zhejiang STV has gained 850 million views on Weibo and many Chinese netizens commended Weibo for asking the station to give a proper reply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Do you still have a conscience? For the recording effect of the program, Gao fell down but you continued to record the program and missed the golden rescue time. We need the truth,�?one netizen said <a name="_GoBack"></a>on Weibo.</span></p>

<p>Zhang Jinlai, 60, better known by his stage name Liu Xiao Ling Tong, was the best Monkey King in the eyes of a lot of Chinese who grew up watching the 1986 TV series<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em> and its later 2000 sequel. The star recently announced on Sina Weibo that he will return to the role for an upcoming movie version of the classic story, causing droves of Chinese netizens to wax nostalgic on social media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My happiest time in the day was when I could sit in front of the TV and watch<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em> with my parents after dinner,&#8221; commented one netizen on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s compelling performance in<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em> was greatly praised by critics and helped him win the Best Actor award at the sixth Golden Eagle Awards in 1988.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese netizens congratulated and gave their blessings to South Korean singer and actress Jeon Hye-bin after the news that she would be getting married on Saturday hit the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations! Hope you will be happy all the time,&#8221; a Sina Weibo user commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all fans, however, were ecstatic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she can find her own happiness, but I really don&#8217;t want to accept the reality that she will be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actress&#8217;s performance in<br />

<p>Argentine soccer player Lionel Messi, who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team, was awarded his sixth Golden Ball Award on Monday, setting a new record for a player with the most number of wins.</p>
<p>Chinese netizens congratulated Messi and said he deserves the award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Messi, a man like a god,&#8221; &#8220;Congratulations! Please stay healthy and continue to play brilliantly,&#8221; Sina Weibo users wrote congratulating the star athlete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides his fame in the field of soccer, Messi has also been praised for his humble nature and showing love for his family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;His reputation comes naturally from his real distinction. He is my model both professionally and in life,&#8221; posted one netizen on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">US First Lady Melania Trump Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Melania Trump has a White House suite of her own, is less than chummy with first daughter Ivanka, and uses her wardrobe to make statements, a new biography about the US first lady says.</p>
<p><em>Free, Melania</em>, an unauthorized look at US President Donald Trump&#8217;s wife by CNN reporter Kate Bennett, was just released on Tuesday, but already has official Washington buzzing about its contents.</p>
<p>At 49, and three years into her husband&#8217;s administration, the Slovenia-born ex-model remains genuinely private and &#8220;mysterious&#8221; to much of the public, while acutely aware of all that is said about her and her husband, says Bennett.</p>
<p>But she is hardly the docile third wife of an extremely powerful man accused of being a serial womanizer, the author writes.</p>
<p>Instead, Melania Trump is prepared to let her husband know what she thinks &#8211; and to use her sharp elbows when she feels slighted.</p>
<p>The first lady is &#8220;way more powerful and influential with her husband&#8221; than the public knows, Bennett says.</p>
<p>The author confirms reports in 2018 that Melania Trump was responsible for the firing of a senior White House national security official, Mira Ricardel, after the first lady felt slighted during a October 2018 trip to Africa.</p>
<p>The book also confirms that the first lady lives in a two-room suite on the third floor of the White House &#8211; one floor up from the president&#8217;s master bedroom.</p>
<p>The suite offers her extra space to do her hair and makeup. She also has an exercise room with a Pilates machine.</p>
<p>In another revelation, Bennett said the kidney treatment that led to Melania Trump&#8217;s 25-day absence from public view in 2018 was much more serious and painful than previously revealed.</p>
<p>While she speaks little in public, the first lady finds her voice in her clothes, Bennett says.</p>
<p>That was clear when she donned an olive green Zara coat in June 2018 with the words &#8220;I REALLY DON&#8217;T CARE, DO U?&#8221; on the back.</p>
<p>Some thought it was an attack on President Trump&#8217;s policies toward migrant children, and by others as a brickbat for the press.</p>
<p>But Bennett says it in fact was directed at step-daughter Ivanka Trump, who Melania Trump sees as sometimes usurping the first lady&#8217;s role.</p>
<p>Their relationship is described in the book as &#8220;cordial, not close.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bennett also says that when Melania Trump wears pantsuits and other menswear styles, it signals unhappiness with her husband, &#8220;because Trump notoriously likes to see women in tight, short, ubersexy and feminine dresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each thing she does has meaning to it, even the clothing she wears,&#8221; writes Bennett.</p>
<p>The book does not have any direct input from the first lady, whose husband has declared Bennett&#8217;s network an enemy of his administration.</p>
<p>It labels the first lady&#8217;s &#8220;Be Best&#8221; campaign against bullying a poorly executed flop, but otherwise is generally positive.</p>
<p>Bennett, whose beat is first lady and the Trump family, appears to be deeply sympathetic to Melania Trump, who is often painted as a prisoner of her husband by his critics.</p>
<p>That view spawned the online meme &#8220;Free Melania&#8221; &#8211; and inspired the book&#8217;s cryptic title.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t need freeing of any kind,&#8221; says Bennett.</p>

<p>A US woman who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew criticized the royal&#8217;s &#8220;ridiculous excuses&#8221; in an interview aired on Monday.</p>
<p>The interview was recorded before Andrew&#8217;s own BBC interview, which prompted him to stand down from public duties because of a backlash at his defense of his friendship with Epstein.</p>
<p>But Virginia Giuffre called on the British public to support her as she dismissed claims initially made by the prince&#8217;s backers that a photograph apparently showing him with his arm around her might not be genuine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored,&#8221; she told the BBC&#8217;s<br />
<em>Panorama</em> program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m calling BS [bullshit] on this. He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there&#8217;s only one of us telling the truth,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real photo. I&#8217;ve given it to the FBI for their investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew himself doubted the authenticity of the photograph during his interview, saying &#8220;nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giuffre has alleged she was trafficked to have sex with friends of Epstein when she was 17. Epstein was found dead in a New York prison in August awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She described how Epstein preyed on her once he knew she came from a vulnerable background, having already suffered sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The financier initially lured her with an offer as a job as a masseuse, but soon began abusing her, according to Giuffre.</p>
<p>She accused Epstein of bringing her to London in 2001, where she was introduced to Andrew and Epstein&#8217;s socialite girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prince asked her for a dance at a nightclub, she recalled, telling<br />
<em>Panorama</em> he was &#8220;the most hideous dancer I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;His sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just like grossed out from it but I knew I had to keep him happy because that&#8217;s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ill-judged&#8217; friendship<br /></strong><br />
<br />The prince told the BBC he was unable to sweat at the time due to a medical condition he developed after serving as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands War in 1982.</p>
<p>After the nightclub, Giuffre &#8211; then known as Roberts &#8211; said that Maxwell told her: &#8220;I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She and Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s second son later had sex at Maxwell&#8217;s house in central London, she alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was disgusting,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said &#8216;thanks&#8217; and walked out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew, 59, said he did not remember meeting Giuffre and that he &#8220;absolutely and categorically&#8221; did not have sex with her.</p>
<p>But an email discovered by<br />
<em>Panorama</em> appeared to show Andrew writing to Maxwell in 2015 with &#8220;specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.&#8221;</p>
<p>She replied &#8220;have some info &#8211; call me when you have a moment,&#8221; according to the BBC investigation.</p>
<p>Giuffre admitted to having a &#8220;foggy memory&#8221; over dates and places when she was asked about inconsistencies in her story.</p>
<p>But she added: &#8220;I implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being OK.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked. This is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guy&#8217;s royalty.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Panorama</em> reported that Andrew could be served with subpoenas if he returns to the US, with lawyers for five of Epstein&#8217;s victims demanding that the prince testify in their court cases abut how he witnessed people being given massages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After his BBC interview, Andrew issued a statement in which he said &#8220;I&#8230; unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein&#8221; and &#8220;deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement from Buckingham Palace said they &#8220;emphatically denied that The Duke of York [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Panorama</em> also interviewed another of Epstein&#8217;s victims, who made further allegations against Maxwell.</p>
<p>Sarah Ransome told the program that she &#8220;controlled the girls&#8230; like the madam.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clive James, the Australian broadcaster, writer, critic and poet who charmed generations of Britons with his humor and wit, has died at the age of 80, his agents said Wednesday.</p>
<p>James died &#8220;peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family and his books&#8221; in Cambridge, eastern England, on Sunday, United Agents said in a statement.</p>
<p>A private funeral attended by family and close friends took place on Wednesday in the chapel at Pembroke College in Cambridge University, where he read English literature as a student in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The charismatic and erudite broadcaster, who left Sydney for England in late 1961 and made his career in Britain, had fought a long battle with leukemia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clive died almost 10 years after his first terminal diagnosis and one month after he laid down his pen for the last time,&#8221; UA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He endured his ever-multiplying illnesses with patience and good humor, knowing until the last moment that he had experienced more than his fair share of this &#8216;great, good world.'&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his name as The Observer newspaper&#8217;s TV critic for a decade from 1972, where he turned the TV review into somewhat of an art form.</p>
<p>His own hit TV show,<br />
<em>Clive James on Television</em>, fronted with his wise-cracking presenting style, put some the world&#8217;s most bizarre programs under the spotlight &#8211; notably clips of the Japanese game show<br />
<em>Endurance</em>.</p>
<p>Another regular guest was the Cuban singer Margarita Pracatan, who paid tribute on Wednesday to James&#8217; intelligence, talent &#8220;and beautiful way of living.&#8221;</p>
<p>James pioneered the &#8220;postcard&#8221; format of travel documentaries.</p>
<p>He retired from mainstream television in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Penned his own obituary</strong></p>
<p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), presented him with a special lifetime achievement award in 2015.</p>
<p>BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: &#8220;Clive James was a clever, witty and thought-provoking broadcaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a huge range of talents and everything he did was essential listening or viewing. He is irreplaceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>James wrote several novels and poetry books and received the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal, a major Australian literature award, in 2003.</p>
<p>He published several volumes of his memoirs, including<br />
<em>The Blaze of Obscurity</em> about his years in television.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek in February this year, James set about compiling an autobiographical anthology of poems called<br />
<em>The Fire Of Joy</em>, which was finished a month ago.</p>
<p>During his long illness, James penned his own obituary, regularly updating it on his website.</p>
<p>He said it would &#8220;serve as a cheaper obituary than anything most newspapers are likely to have in the freezer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will keep updating it until they carry me to the slab, during which journey I will try to give details of my final medication,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Miller dies, 85</strong></p>
<p>James&#8217; death was announced after the family of theater director Jonathan Miller said he died on Wednesday at the age of 85.</p>
<p>Miller once appeared as a guest on James&#8217; chat show<br />
<em>The Late Clive James</em> in 1988, in which he discussed his love of stationery.</p>
<p>The polymath first found fame in the early 1960s in the revue<br />
<em>Beyond The Fringe</em> with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.</p>
<p>Miller directed theater and television plays, including<br />
<em>The Merchant Of Venice</em> at the National Theatre and six of BBC television&#8217;s Shakespeare plays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our father died this morning peacefully at home with his family around him following a long battle with Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; Miller&#8217;s family said in a statement.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s National Theatre called Miller a &#8220;legendary figure across theater and opera,&#8221; while the English National Opera said &#8220;his contribution to comedy, theater and ENO in particular was immeasurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO&#8217;s most celebrated and popular opera productions.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct to turn himself in to face multiple charges related to allegations of sexual assault on Friday. According to reports, Weinstein is facing charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and first-degree criminal sex act in another case. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>A New York judge has ruled that<br />
<em>The Sopranos</em> actress Annabella Sciorra is allowed to testify at fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s trial, court documents showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a decision filed late Tuesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke also denied a last-ditch attempt by Weinstein&#8217;s attorneys to have predatory sexual assault charges against their client dropped.</p>
<p>Weinstein &#8211; once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood &#8211; has pleaded not guilty to five charges of sexual assault relating to two women.</p>
<p>His trial is scheduled to start on January 6, 2020. He faces life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>One of the women alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013, while the other claims he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.</p>
<p>His lawyers had sought to prevent prosecutors from calling a third woman, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein over the winter of 1993-94, to give evidence.</p>
<p>Burke rejected their request.</p>
<p>The woman is not named in court documents but it widely understood to be Sciorra, 59.</p>
<p>She helped trigger the #MeToo movement in October 2017 when she told The New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at her home in Manhattan in 1993.</p>
<p>Weinstein, 67, cannot be charged with raping Sciorra because the statute of limitations has expired. Prosecutors hope that her giving evidence as a corroborating witness will strengthen their case.</p>
<p>Weinstein has been accused of harassment and assault by more than 80 women, including stars such as Ashley Judd.</p>
<p>The co-founder of Miramax and producer of<br />
<em>Pulp Fiction</em>, has always insisted his sexual relationships were consensual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>Music industry mogul Scooter Braun said Friday his dispute with megastar Taylor Swift over her music catalogue has left his family receiving &#8220;death threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 29-year-old pop artist began publicly sparring with Braun this summer over his company&#8217;s purchase of her former label, Big Machine Label Group, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.</p>
<p>Last week, Swift &#8211; known for her calculating social media strategy &#8211; said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were &#8220;exercising tyrannical control,&#8221; claiming they were preventing her from performing at an upcoming awards gala and releasing a Netflix documentary including songs from her early catalogue.</p>
<p>In the post she pleaded with her fans and fellow artists to back her cause.</p>
<p>Braun had not publicly spoken out on the matter, but early Friday dropped a lengthy Instagram post saying Swift&#8217;s appeal had resulted in &#8220;numerous death threats directed at my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight,&#8221; Braun wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;While disappointed that you have remained silent after being notified by your attorney 4 days ago of these ongoing threats, I&#8217;m still hopeful that we can fix this.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Michael Jackson fans attend a screening of <em>Square One</em> on Sunday in Beijing. Photo: Courtesy of mjjcn.com</p>
<p>Chinese Michael Jackson fans paid tribute to the singer following the screening of Chinese-Canadian Danny Wu&#8217;s documentary<br />
<em>Square One</em> in Beijing on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film is an investigation into 1993 allegations of sexual abuse against Jackson brought by the family of the alleged victim Jordan Chandler. It uncovers new evidence and information in defense of the singer through interviews with the people closest to the case, such as Jackson&#8217;s nephew and the legal assistant to the accuser&#8217;s lawyers in 1993.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Square One</em> premiered in Hollywood on September 28 and in London on October 5. That same day, it made its global debut on Wu&#8217;s YouTube channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In LA, the biggest shock to me was how many people showed up. And you know there were a lot of high-profile people over there. They were Hollywood actors. They were big YouTube stars, Michael Jackson&#8217;s lawyers, his family… I got a standing ovation in the end which surprised me as well. In London, same thing. People were more reserved, standing ovation at the end, which I didn&#8217;t expect at all,&#8221; Wu told the Global Times after the screening and a Q&amp;A session with the audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feeling connected</strong></p>
<p>With support from China&#8217;s biggest Jackson fan website, mjjcn.com, the documentary&#8217;s Chinese-subtitled version was screened in eight cities across China including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chengdu, with Beijing the last stop. Tickets for the film sold out quickly, as the tour attracted a multitude of the late singer&#8217;s fans in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the most connected fan groups I&#8217;ve ever seen anywhere. Because, not only are they online, but they are also going to meet up in real life having real life interactions, which does not happen very often in the West,&#8221; said Wu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wu attended screenings in different cities and enjoyed the discussions with audiences, most of whom were Michael Jackson fans. After the screening, one fan said that the film felt like a redemption for the singer as it presents the truth to the public, while a mother said she brought her 11-year-old son with her, hoping he&#8217;d learn more about Jackson as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see how connected they feel to Michael Jackson. I realize that this is way beyond music and dance. This is people really connecting to him at a deeper level. I don&#8217;t think I really understood that until this trip,&#8221; Wu added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Doing some digging</strong></p>
<p>Premiering at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 25,<br />
<em>Leaving Neverland</em> featured accounts from two former child stars Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who accused the late singer of sexually assaulting them in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In its review, Variety said it &#8220;offers devastatingly powerful and convincing testimony that Michael Jackson was guilty of child sexual abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu watched<br />
<em>Leaving Neverland</em> as well. He said that after noticing what he felt were a lot of inconsistencies in the film, he started doing research on his own. In April, he posted on his YouTube channel his interviews with Taj Jackson, Michael Jackson&#8217;s nephew, and Brandi Jackson, the pop star&#8217;s niece in a piece titled<br />
<em> Returning to Neverland: Taj and Brandi Jackson Interview</em>. Wu noted that the interviews received quite a bit of attention from Jackson fans, which he thinks helped gain people&#8217;s trust as an investigator on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2005, Jackson was faced with a second child molestation case, which ended up with his acquittal. Wu said that during the trial, he heard that more than one person who knew Chandler testified in court saying that Chandler told them that nothing had ever happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one ever confirmed [that people had testified]. But it just became my obsession to find one of these names. And I looked into it for a long time. And I got a name, there was Josephine Zohny,&#8221; said Wu.</p>
<p>It took Wu some effort to talk Zohny into defending Jackson publicly. After his interview with her, Wu realized that one witness may not be convincing enough so he changed his format and turn his YouTube series into a documentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the West, all the online discussions about whether Michael Jackson was guilty or not. All the people who think he was guilty, they always go back to one point. Why did he pay the settlement? Why did he pay a kid 20 million dollars? So that was the root of all the problems… But the 1993 case has never gone to trial. So there are a lot of myths and legends around that case. So I just kept building around it. I kept adding new people in, and people kept dropping out,&#8221; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To be continued</strong></p>
<p>Wu and Michael Jackson&#8217;s Chinese fans believe in the singer&#8217;s innocence and plan to show their support by promoting<br />
<em>Square One</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The documentary will soon be screened in Amsterdam, and a new version different from the YouTube version will likely be available on Amazon Prime in the US in January 2020. As for China, mjjcn.com is considering collaborating with a domestic video-streaming website to screen the film.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad used to bring DVDs of Michael Jackson dancing. And he was like &#8216;Yeah, let me show you something impressive.&#8217; And we just watched Michael Jackson DVDs all day. So that&#8217;s like a very big part of my childhood. I feel I owe so much happiness to Michael Jackson for this family time so that it&#8217;s only right I&#8217;m doing this now,&#8221; said Wu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what he&#8217;d say to the singer, Wu answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying my best. I&#8217;m doing my part. And I hope that can be appreciated and maybe the world one day will see you for who you really are.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski faced mounting pressure Sunday after threatening to sue over claims by a former actress that he violently raped her in the 1970s, the latest in a string of sexual assault accusations against him.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old filmmaker rejected the allegation, but few from the world of French cinema have come out in support of Polanski, who fled to France in 1978 after admitting to raping a 13-year-old girl at the Los Angeles home of Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>Jean Dujardin, the star of Polanski&#8217;s latest film, which comes out in France on Wednesday, has abruptly canceled a prime-time interview on the TF1 television station set for Sunday.</p>
<p>And the French artists&#8217; guild ARP could meet soon to discuss his exclusion, its vice president told the Parisien newspaper.</p>
<p>An ARP spokesman later told AFP that although no board meeting had been set, &#8220;If we are going to decide on Roman Polanski&#8217;s membership, we will do so with the approval of filmmakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Monnier, a photographer and former actress, has accused Polanski, who is French-Polish, of an &#8220;extremely violent&#8221; assault and rape at his chalet in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad in 1975, when she was 18.</p>
<p>Monnier said he tried to make her swallow a pill during the attack, and later made a tearful apology while demanding a promise that she never tell anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was going to die,&#8221; she said in an open letter published by Le Parisien, which also interviewed her and said it had contacted witnesses who confirmed the account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Polanski disputes in the strongest terms this rape accusation,&#8221; his lawyer Herve Temime told AFP in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working on the legal action to bring against this publication,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Criminal past&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>The rape claim has rocked a French film industry already reeling after a top actress last week said she was sexually harassed by the director of her first film when she was just 12.</p>
<p>Adele Haenel, whose account has garnered an outpouring of support, on Saturday urged others to speak out in support of Monnier and &#8220;take notice of her story.&#8221;</p>
<p>French prosecutors have opened a sexual assault investigation into Haenel&#8217;s claims, even though Haenel herself never filed a legal complaint.</p>
<p>Polanski and his new film,<br />
<em>An Officer and a Spy</em>, had already courted controversy in September when it was included in the Venice film festival, where it took second place.</p>
<p>Monnier, who acted in a few films in the 1980s, said the release of the film, about one of the most notorious errors of justice in French history, the Dreyfus affair, had prompted her to finally speak out.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could he benefit from public funds to instrumentalize history, and in doing so rewrite his own to cover up his criminal past?&#8221; she wrote, referring to French subsidies for film productions.</p>
<p>&#8220;He pummelled me until I gave in and then raped me, making me do all sorts of things,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>She had previously written to France&#8217;s first lady Brigitte Macron, who forwarded two letters to France&#8217;s equality minister Marlene Schiappa, who has pushed for new measures to combat sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Schiappa wrote to Monnier in March 2018 and hailed her courage &#8220;in daring to break the silence,&#8221; though the alleged attack was beyond France&#8217;s statute of limitations for prosecution.</p>
<p>But her account may prove a turning point for French cinema, where the MeToo movement against rape and sexual assault that roiled Hollywood has not prompted as deep a reckoning of abuses in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar outlaw</strong></p>
<p>Monnier is the first Frenchwoman to accuse Polanski of rape. Since he was arrested in California in 1977 on charges of drugging and raping 13-year-old Samantha Gailey, now known as Samantha Geimer, five other women including Monnier have come forward to allege that he either raped or sexually assaulted them.</p>
<p>He has denied all the claims, but they forced him to abandon the presidency of the 2017 Cesars, the French equivalent of the Oscars, and the following year he was expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Alain Terzian, president of France&#8217;s APC film promotion association which oversees the Cesars, which includes Polanski as a member, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Both France and Poland have refused to extradite Polanski to the US, where California prosecutors are pressing their case even after Polanski paid Geimer $225,000 in an out-of-court settlement in 1994.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Geimer criticized Monnier for not speaking up sooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking heat for not being more supportive of accusers who use film release dates to schedule their revelations with the press &amp; sat silently while I was called a liar &amp; a gold digging whore in 1977 knowing they may have prevented it, if they had the truth &amp; my mom&#8217;s courage,&#8221; she wrote on Saturday.</p>
