<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will restore tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina. On the same day, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) announced punitive duties on $2.4 billion of imports from France as the country&#8217;s digital services tax &#8220;unfairly targets US companies.&#8221; The USTR also said similar investigations could be conducted against Italy, Turkey and Austria.</p>
<p>The US is losing control by once again swiping the world with tariffs as a weapon and declaring war against the whole world without scruples. This shows that our world is in chaos and the fragile world governance system is basically paralyzed. Something like the law of the jungle that was once abandoned is coming back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday that the US tariffs threats on French goods are &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; But they are nothing against overwhelming US moves. French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> has called for an independent Europe, which differs from Washington&#8217;s ideas. It is not surprising even if the tariffs are a US warning to France.</p>
<p>What kind of era are we living in? Perhaps the answer will come after years.</p>
<p>On one hand, technology is pushing a globalization trend which appears irreversible. But on the other hand, narrow nationalism and populism are experiencing an ill-timed surge. Universal education of all mankind has been achieved quite well, but oversimplified mind-sets and provocative extreme slogans are prevailing.</p>
<p>The criteria of right and wrong are intricately intertwined with the benefits pattern. Public opinion has been used as a weapon, and stirring up emotions can often overwhelm sobering truths or common sense on both the community and world level, making it tougher to separate truth from falsehood.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the US has been exploiting its strength to force the international order to first serve its own national interests. Many countries have fallen victim and have been resisting the US to varying degrees. The actual situation is that the US can hardly bring the whole world under its dominion, but it is also difficult for other countries to revolt. The world is in such a dilemma.</p>
<p>Facing US nonsense and other countries&#8217; anger, Chinese society must do the following things well.</p>
<p>First, China should in no way mistakenly believe that the patience of all countries will run out, and an &#8220;anti-US wave&#8221; will rage like a storm. This is not the basic political logic of today&#8217;s world. In the face of US power, most countries will protect themselves first, and cutting losses by all means will be their actual response.</p>
<p>Second, such a period may last some time. Even if there are political changes inside the US, the world cannot go back to the way it used to be. It is hard to predict what the world will be like.</p>
<p>Third, China is the main target of US suppression, and this won&#8217;t change. We shouldn&#8217;t go all out and collide head-on with the US. It can only contain China in limited areas, which cannot affect China&#8217;s rise. As long as we hold our ground, most US provocations are beating the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China should focus on development and exploring more common interests and values with other countries. US policies toward China are irrational in many aspects with ugly double standards. As long as China better develops and sincerely opens up, we will be capable of dealing with the US while we increasingly receive the support of the international community. These two goals are what we should strive to gradually achieve.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> announced Monday that China would suspend reviewing applications for US warships and aircraft to make port calls in Hong Kong and will impose sanctions on five NGOs, including the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and Human Rights Watch. These measures, the first wave of countermeasures against the &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,&#8221; will have a real impact on related departments and organizations.</p>
<p>The measures demonstrate Chinese government&#8217;s determination to not allow certain US and Western forces to wantonly make waves on the Hong Kong issue. If the US side continues to provoke on Hong Kong, it is expected that China will take follow-up actions.</p>
<p>Because of &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; the US can exert some influence in Hong Kong. But Washington shouldn&#8217;t get the illusion that it can turn the influence into jurisdiction over Hong Kong, and make the city its sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The measures announced on Monday are mild, as China has exercised restraint so far, but it doesn&#8217;t mean Beijing won&#8217;t hit back with harsher measures, if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fives NGOs such as NED are closely connected to US authorities, whose funding directly or indirectly comes from US government allocations. These organizations are at the forefront of US values infiltration to advance American national interests. These organizations have played a disgraceful role in stirring social turmoil in many countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time that China has openly imposed sanctions on US NGOs, which doesn&#8217;t imply that Beijing thinks riots in Hong Kong were solely caused by external factors. But certain forces from the US did exert a disruptive impact. Sanctioning them is a naturally result of China&#8217;s national strength and sovereignty will.</p>
<p>The US side shouldn&#8217;t feel surprised by Beijing&#8217;s announcement to suspend port calls of US warships and aircraft. The US military may feel inconvenient since they traditionally stop in Hong Kong for maintenance, but they can argue with the US Congress and the White House.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The countermeasures announced on Monday also sent a clear signal to radical forces in Hong Kong that they shouldn&#8217;t count on external forces to dictate the Hong Kong situation. The city is part of China and no force can change or weaken this reality. China has abundant capability to adopt tough measures when necessary to stop external forces from causing any real harm to China&#8217;s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Liberation Army is also stationed in Hong Kong. It is not a decoration, but provides fundamental support for Hong Kong&#8217;s stability. Hong Kong, under China&#8217;s rule, connects China and the West. If the US wants to broaden communication through Hong Kong, we welcome it. But if Washington wants to abandon this platform, so be it. It is also our attitude to other Western countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Hong Kong&#8217;s tradition to connect China and the West. However, if Hong Kong society can&#8217;t stop internal disruptive forces and the city can no longer perform such a function, then the city will experience an economic structural adjustment.</p>
<p>No force should ponder the idea of undermining China&#8217;s sovereignty over Hong Kong. The path is a dead end.</p>

<p>Wang Liqiang, a self-claimed high-level Chinese spy who defected to Australia, seems to have been having trouble backing up his story. According to the latest news, Australian security agencies concluded that Wang might be at most &#8220;a bit player on the fringes of the espionage community.&#8221; Some Australian media outlets even described this case as a &#8220;spy farce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over a week ago, Wang shocked Australian and Western public opinion. Wang claimed that he had &#8220;infiltrated the student movement in Hong Kong&#8221; and &#8220;interfered with elections in Taiwan.&#8221; His words seemed customized for the current political situations. Many political forces felt as if they had hit the jackpot, and a whirlwind blew up.</p>
<p>How could a 27-year-old participate in a series of espionage activities? It sounded like Wang was a liar. China soon released a courtroom video of Wang&#8217;s conviction for fraud in 2016. Many of his misdeeds were exposed. It seems that the farce with which Wang showed his loyalty to Australia&#8217;s anti-China forces and the latter utilized him to fuel anti-China opinions could not continue anymore.</p>
<p>This case revealed the lack of morality of quite a few Australians in the intelligence community and press circles. They should not have been fooled by Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, they fell into the trap willingly, taking advantage of Wang regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s case helped the Hong Kong opposition win the district council elections. And Tsai Ing-wen&#8217;s authority hyped this case and detained the alleged leaders of a so-called Chinese mainland intelligence agency based in Hong Kong as claimed by Wang. However, the case collapsed promptly.</p>
<p>But the Chinese people should by no means believe that the Australian intelligence community and media outlets will be ashamed and restrain themselves from discrediting China. Their mentality has already been extremely ideological. In terms of throwing mud at China, they only focus on the effects it can produce, rather than whether it is right or wrong. No matter what setbacks they have suffered, they can always be forgiven and continue their smears against China fearlessly.</p>
<p>Recent accusations made by Western public opinion against China, which were over-exaggerated and full of loopholes, as well as their overt double standards, have shocked the Chinese people over and over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1083026.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reform and opening-up</a> has offered Chinese more access to Western public opinion. We once believed in the &#8220;objectivity&#8221; and &#8220;fairness&#8221; of Western public opinion institutions, but gradually, Chinese people have realized that they are far from perfect as we used to believe. In the past two years, we have witnessed all kinds of unscrupulous and ugly performances.</p>
<p>Some Western media outlets have established standardized production lines of China reports, which prioritize value and standpoint.</p>
<p>For a long time to come, China will be unable to change this paranoia of Western public opinion. But fortunately, the Chinese have clearly observed the Western media&#8217;s serious prejudice and hostility toward China. The previous positive image of the Western media among the Chinese public has collapsed. It is hard for them to affect Chinese society as they did in the past. They are marginalizing themselves in Chinese society.</p>
<p>China needs to make efforts to dismantle the influence of the West&#8217;s China-related reports worldwide. The work will be tough, but worthwhile to pursue. Only by gradually achieving this task can China&#8217;s soft power make a necessary breakthrough.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>After US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (US time) signed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, some US politicians who had instigated the act excitedly made fanatical remarks on social media, and some Western media also participated in the chorus. Some people in the US and other Western countries have been deeply caught in an ideological frenzy. Their goal is not just Hong Kong. They try to make Hong Kong a pawn for them to contain the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Chinese public opinion has generally been tough and calm. Chinese people support the central government&#8217;s pushback to such serious interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs, warning the US that the move only leads to a dead end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The calmness comes from Chinese people&#8217;s clear understanding of Hong Kong&#8217;s history and future and the great strength of China, making it impossible for Hong Kong to be a pawn of the US or the West. If some US politicians insist on walking toward a dead end, they will ruin US interests in the city. Although this may bring some trouble to China&#8217;s development, it can never prevent China from rising.</p>
<p>The &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle is not only in line with the interests of the mainland and Hong Kong, but also connects China with the West and with the world. It was an exploration and effort of all parties to reach a win-win situation under the mainland&#8217;s relatively isolated condition at that time. Judging from Hong Kong&#8217;s development and its current global status, the effort has been successful. The interaction between the mainland and Hong Kong is closer, and their connection with the world is wider. Development of global finance, economy and trade needs such connection.</p>
<p>It is extremely irrational for the US to launch the act. The US will also be a loser, and it does not lose any less than the Chinese mainland. According to the Congressional Research Service, the US had the largest trade surplus with Hong Kong in 2018 &#8211; $31.1 billion. About 290 US companies had regional headquarters in Hong Kong and another 434 had regional offices. This means the US has real interests in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>If the US is unwilling to pursue such common interests, Hong Kong may as well go another way that leads to prosperity. Hong Kong&#8217;s status today was not given by the US, and the US cannot cut off Hong Kong&#8217;s connection with the world. China is a large economy. Cities in the mainland such as Shanghai and Shenzhen have their unique positions in the global economic and trade pattern, and Hong Kong will also have huge room for improvement.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s US politics have somewhat been abducted by its extreme ideology. The US has become increasingly furious as it finds no way to improve its competitiveness. US Senator Marco Rubio, for example, is the most extreme nationalist and ideological fanatic. A person like him will not be welcomed by Chinese public opinion. However, such an extremist actually becomes a US senator, and US policy toward China is led by these people&#8217;s sentiments. Social media is exacerbating such frenzy. US mainstream elites are also becoming tougher. These may drag China-US relations into a vicious circle.</p>
<p>The current anti-China sentiment in the US exceeds the anti-US sentiment in China. China knows well that the US is going to suppress it and we feel angry on some specific issues. However, China has not formed a comprehensive anti-US sentiment yet, nor has China launched policies to allow bilateral relations to deteriorate. China is not prepared to do so, either. Indeed, China will pay close attention to how far the US goes in this frenzy.</p>
<p>This is no longer the world in the early days after the end of the Cold War. The US cannot cut off China&#8217;s connection with the world. Even if the US breaks relations with China, US allies will not follow it and most countries will keep developing relations with China. If the US insists on unilateralism and zero-sum game, it is choosing an irreversible decline for itself.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This amounts to typical US interference in China&#8217;s Hong Kong affairs.</p>
<p>Being part of China, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the country&#8217;s governance. Washington has no jurisdiction over Hong Kong, but the legislation tries to legitimize its right to affect Beijing&#8217;s policies on the city, which is a clear violation of Chinese sovereignty. Imagine if China takes action to interfere in the US presidential elections or adopts a policy regulating how Canberra should treat its ethnic minority groups, will there be a strong backlash?</p>
<p>It is clearly not the time for China to reason with the US, but to be rational in China-US conflicts. We must prevent more Hongkongers from being misled by US craftiness, which will eventually harm their interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington is determined to turn Hong Kong into a new front to strategically pressure Beijing. Some beguiled Hongkongers have been taken over by the illusion that the law could help their city gain a higher degree of autonomy, as they imagine Beijing would be deterred by the US legislation, and thus make major concessions that are not in line with the Basic Law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s key countermeasure against the law is to further clarify the fundamental rules of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, completely dispel Hong Kong radical opposition&#8217;s pipe dream to realize &#8220;absolute universal suffrage,&#8221; correct their misunderstanding of the principle, and firmly repulse US assessments of the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We must leave no room for collusion and interaction between Hong Kong&#8217;s radical opposition and the US government. They may act alone and bear the costs, but shall never dream of jointly coercing Beijing.</p>
<p>It is the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress that holds the power of interpreting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Facing the US&#8217; potential move to cancel Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status with this law, Hong Kong society needs to behave in accordance with the Basic Law on major issues and cooperate with the central government to offer no pretext for the US to use this law. If the radical opposition interprets the Basic Law in an unconstitutional manner, mainstream society in Hong Kong must stand up against them and stop them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Hong Kong society has force strong enough to resist constitutional arrangements, thus helping the US resort to its law and causing further damage to the city&#8217;s business environment, it will be Hong Kong society&#8217;s misfortune. The city will suffer some pain and make necessary adjustments to its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status is stipulated by the Basic Law, rather than awarded by the US. As long as the society sobers up and works hard with the motherland&#8217;s support, no external forces can truly wield influence over its destiny.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the law also threatens to sanction Hongkongers who do not cooperate with the US. This will suppress neutral space for people with different ideas and further tear the city apart. The only way to maintain the solidarity of Hong Kong is to resist US provocation and prevent more people from joining hands with the opposition for fear of US sanctions. Efforts to fight the forces colluding with the US should be stepped up, and the corresponding laws need to be improved. There is no way to allow traitors to prevail and patriots to suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;One country, two systems&#8221; is China&#8217;s independent constitutional arrangement and US intervention damages its external environment. Hong Kong society should be vigilant. To maintain &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; the Chinese mainland and the HKSAR need to work together. Anyone who colludes with external forces to undermine &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; must pay a heavy price.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The results of the Hong Kong District Council elections have triggered online discussions among Chinese mainland netizens, with many expressing their dissatisfaction. As the mainland has attached great importance to the Hong Kong situation, such online reaction is to be expected as mainland netizens are patriotic and hope the city can recover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mainland Chinese should view the Hong Kong situation accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the issue should be perceived from an international perspective. Hong Kong&#8217;s capitalist system has linked it with the West in many aspects. The protests that were ignited by the introduction of the extradition bill is an internal affair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demonstrations became devastating due to the hardline strategy implemented by the US against China. In this sense, dealing with the Hong Kong issue, to a large extent, is equivalent to handling relations with the US and the West. The challenge has grown bigger. China must face this development and deal with the situation with a firmer and more mature stance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong affairs should be examined within the framework of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle. Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have different political systems. Some Hongkongers do not have a clear understanding of national interests or their interests, and thus their attitude to oppose violence isn&#8217;t clear. In other words, the issue hasn&#8217;t been addressed decisively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>China needs to guide the Hong Kong situation toward healthy development under the principles of Basic Law, but also must be prepared for the possibility the city could go astray. The severity of the issue must be analyzed, whether it is out of control, or what the consequences would be, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s rule of law has been destroyed. Undoubtedly, this is a severe issue. Ending the violence and chaos is, first and foremost, the responsibility of Hong Kong society. The protesters have staged a show against the country, which has excited the US and other Western forces as they think it would cause trouble for Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s control over Hong Kong&#8217;s constitution hasn&#8217;t been affected. Rioters and their supporters have been unable to undermine it. The country&#8217;s armed forces could turn the situation at any time, but so far, there has not been an urgent need for such action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy is more complicated than first expected. The fundamental reason today is how the global situation is more complicated than it was decades ago. However, the issue remains an internal affair embedded in the policy&#8217;s framework. Due to international interference, the city&#8217;s affairs have become highly politicized among an evolving global landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A practical and realistic approach is needed to find a solution. If previous policies have proven to be outdated and ineffective, then it&#8217;s imperative that adjustments are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must face the situation of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy. It should not be assumed that a simple resolution is available based on Chinese mainland logic. It&#8217;s abnormal for a modern city to ruin its modernity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mainland needs to strengthen communication with Hong Kong, which is not an easy task. The mainland should increase its level of intimacy with Hong Kong residents and reduce value differences through reform and concerted efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If China can take the initiative in its competition with the US, it would build confidence among Hongkongers and inspire them to love the country while making the mainland more attractive from their perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again launched direct attacks against the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Tuesday, claiming that the Party has engaged in &#8220;systematic repression of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a>.&#8221; This US State Secretary has been constantly peddling his clichés.</p>
<p>Radical political elites in Washington are adjusting their strategy of a public opinion war against China. They are increasingly focusing their efforts on discrediting the CPC, in an attempt to make their large-scale attacks on China less abrupt in the Western context, rouse Westerners&#8217; memory of the Cold War, and disguise their frantic geopolitical siege against China as an ideological battle in the face of &#8220;the threat posed by the CPC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pompeo and his likes have another malicious purpose: They are attempting to reduce the Chinese public&#8217;s resentment against them by shifting their attacks on China to mainly on the CPC. They try to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and the Party, and solicit Chinese domestic endorsement for their criticism. This adjustment is undoubtedly carefully plotted, but only wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Pompeo and his likes must have read some Chinese online posts attacking the CPC gathered by their intelligence agencies, which were written by a tiny minority of Chinese people. Based on past Cold War experience, they thought they had a chance. The US has collected quite a bit of information about China, but they are overly-subjective to make judgments &#8211; they always try to rationalize what they wish.</p>
<p>The CPC has led Chinese people to be truly independent, realize great economic growth in the past decades, fundamentally reshape people&#8217;s livelihood, and regain dignity in the world. The CPC has dedicated itself to the great rejuvenation of China. This is a consensus of Chinese people, and many Westerners cannot imagine how unshakable it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPC is a political party unlike any of those in the Western political systems. It is the builder of the country and it has integrated itself with the country. With parties coming in and leaving office, Western political systems in fact offer every political party exemptions of liability. Hence, the most important ability of Western political parties is to explain and defend themselves. However, shouldering numerous responsibilities for China, the CPC has nowhere to shift liability, but the only option is to lead the country forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPC, as well as the entire China, has always been busy solving problems. China&#8217;s system is oriented to tackling problems. The Party&#8217;s governance may have some flaws, and problems may appear in various places. But Chinese people will criticize the flaws and express dissatisfaction. If it weren&#8217;t for such high-profile attacks launched by Pompeo and his likes, the Chinese people would not stop to ponder over the question: What differences and significance does the CPC have, which triggered their smear? It is because the CPC&#8217;s leadership over China has brought Pompeo and his likes a deep sense of crisis, and because it is the Party that guarantees the country&#8217;s strong cohesion and a reliable mainstay. Despite US launch of an unprecedented and comprehensive trade war and mobilization of all kinds of political means to pressure China, its efforts seem in vain. Pompeo and his likes have figured one thing out: To contain China&#8217;s rise, it is a must to weaken the CPC&#8217;s authority and leadership, otherwise anything they do will be futile.</p>
<p>However, they are pursuing an unreachable goal. The CPC&#8217;s leadership is earned through hard work. It has become an important source of China&#8217;s national strength and a pillar of the country to resist pressures and challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are nearly 90 million members of the CPC in China, which means an extremely solid mass base and the integration between the Party and the country. If anyone hopes to crack down on the CPC, it is impossible to &#8220;break through the vulnerable spot,&#8221; as the confrontation is with the whole of China.</p>
<p>Washington will lead the US to a futile path, because it refuses to treat China realistically and to implement a practical China policy. The CPC places great emphasis on self-revolution. It is carrying out political and organizational construction in accordance with the reality and its own problems. Such process is highly coordinated with China&#8217;s progress, and injects new impetus into its advance. But US elites are sticking in the mud and even going backwards.</p>
<p>Most importantly, their groundless accusations against the CPC are a monstrous lie. China has come out on top of the global development competition. This fact speaks louder than any lie. China has not gone to war for decades. It has been coexisting with the rest of the world peacefully. This fact cannot be wantonly distorted by people like Pompeo. Their lies will not last long.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People dance at a square during a culture and tourism festival themed on Dolan and Qiuci culture in Awat County of Aksu Prefecture, Northwest China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region on October 25. The festival kicked off recently in Aksu Prefecture. Phont:Xinhua</p>
<p>Recently, BBC and several other Western media outlets claimed to have seen the &#8220;leaked documents&#8221; on Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and slandered vocational education and training centers there. For quite some time, the centers have been the target of certain Western media to attack China&#8217;s human rights record, and they are probably going to create more &#8220;leak&#8221; in order to keep up the heat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attacking China on human rights is what the US and Western public opinion institutions are good at. This is not because their accusations are correct, but because they can use their ridiculous rhetoric to instigate the Western public against China. The US and Western media do not actually care about whether doing so benefits China&#8217;s human rights development. What they want is to drive a wedge between China and Western public opinion by presenting a distorted description of China&#8217;s situation, especially the condition of Xinjiang vocational education and training centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western elites who have been attacking China&#8217;s human rights record always evade very basic questions. For example, China&#8217;s political system has greatly promoted economic development. Better living conditions and increased modernization in metropolitan areas, aren&#8217;t those the development of human rights? Western media neglect all of these and just take the side of a few dissidents, always attacking China for the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Xinjiang, they cannot face up to one question: Is having a safe and peaceful living environment a prerequisite for human rights? Xinjiang suffered terrorist attacks for quite a long time, and the situation had almost gone out of control. Wouldn&#8217;t opening vocational education and training centers be a much more peaceful way to restore stability than going through a war like that in Chechnya?&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and the West have different standpoints on the issue of Xinjiang. What China really wants is to bring peaceful life back to the people there, and this is what real human rights are about. The reason the West likes to get involved in this issue is to a large extent out of hypocrisy. The West&#8217;s intention of heating up the issue of Xinjiang is purely driven by geopolitics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese people do not need to be upset by the nonsense Western elites dish out. The world is complicated, and most importantly, China&#8217;s detractors cannot have any real impact on the issue of Xinjiang. Their attacks may seem bustling, but actually turn out to be a bunch of bubbles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, they cannot have any impact on governance in Xinjiang. It has been three years since Xinjiang last saw a terror attack. Today&#8217;s Xinjiang is on its way to rapid recovery, and its booming tourism is the best evidence. Western media blast China nonstop, but they cannot have any actual influence on Xinjiang. They just cannot do anything about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, even with all these efforts that Western media put into, most countries do not follow them at all. Many Muslim countries publicly support China, backing China&#8217;s policy in Xinjiang. The whole &#8220;leaked documents&#8221; drama shows how unwilling Western media outlets are to accept their failure in attacking China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western media outlets take themselves too seriously to even regard their own voices as an expression of the entire world. All they do is just repost among themselves and asking some NGOs, which have been manipulated by certain intelligence agencies to create a circus. All their tricks have been exposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang has been free of the haze of terrorism and extremism. The people in Xinjiang are on their way to a safer and more peaceful life. No one can speak for the people of Xinjiang. They are enjoying the same rights as other places in China. The future of Xinjiang is in their own hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The 2019 Hong Kong District Council Elections were held successfully on Sunday with the opposition capturing more than half of the 452 seats. The result was confirmed and respected. This has shown the central government&#8217;s sincerity in sticking to the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>Pan-democrats gained more influence through the ballot, which requires them to be more responsible to maintain order in Hong Kong. No matter what pan-democrats pursue, they must not do it at the cost of the rule of law, which is a core value of the city. The newly elected pan-democrat councilors should contribute to guiding the Hong Kong society to reach the consensus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being loyal to the Basic Law should be the prerequisite for every Hong Kong politician. This requires them to express political appeals through channels specified by the Basic Law, and respect its purpose.</p>
<p>The Basic Law assures the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, and solidly defends the &#8220;one country&#8221; principle in the city. Pan-democrats of Hong Kong need to be aware of and responsible for promoting coordination between the &#8220;two systems&#8221; and &#8220;one country&#8221; principle in the city. They must not lead the city to confront the central government. It&#8217;s believed most pan-democrats have the awareness of &#8220;one country&#8221; and won&#8217;t allow Hong Kong to become a bridgehead for the West to pressure China. This is the basic political ethics they should adhere to.</p>
<p>It is a wise choice for pan-democrats to promote democracy in Hong Kong while simultaneously safeguarding national security rather than undermining national security. Only after they straighten out this logic will they enjoy a broad and sustainable prospect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong radical opposition figures have colluded with the US and other outside forces in recent years. In the long run, those radicals will pay the price for temporary gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;One country, two systems&#8221; means to let Hong Kong people, not Westerners, rule Hong Kong. Beijing highly respects Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, and won&#8217;t allow Western forces to meddle in Hong Kong affairs. Whoever helps Washington intervene in Hong Kong affairs is putting their political career at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid tensions between China and the US, Hong Kong pan-democrats should steer their political position well, keeping it in line with China&#8217;s national security. They should keep this in mind rather than covet short-term petty benefits and lose themselves.</p>
<p>Dozens of elected district councilors gathered near Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday to show solidarity with radical protesters, a move which highlights their political label. District councils typically focus on community issues, but some newly elected district councilors have acted as if they are members of the Legislative Council. It will go against the Basic Law if they want to turn themselves into the most active political force in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democratic development in the city should be strictly in line with the Basic Law and coordinated with national security. Both Hong Kong and the central government need to figure out how to make it as &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; is still a new thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the world has deeply changed, to sustain &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; Hongkongers and mainlanders should seek truth from facts to solve various problems they face. Hong Kong will have a bright future only when they more closely join hands.</p>
<p>Pan-democrats gained more seats, but they should maintain political sobriety. The young newly elected, in particular, should keep a distance from those who betray the country and Hong Kong, and have the courage to explore a new political path in accordance with the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle. Hong Kong is a part of China, and never will it belong to the US or the West. Only by keeping this in mind and acting accordingly will they have a solid political career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People dance outside the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> International Grand Bazaar in Urumqi, Northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, May 22, 2019.&nbsp;Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>The Washington-headquartered International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on Sunday claimed they acquired secret documents about &#8220;detention camps&#8221; in China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. This is the second so-called leak of secret files about Xinjiang following the New York Times&#8217; &#8220;leaked files&#8221; last week. Western media outlets extensively followed the reports both times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the Australian intelligence agency issued a rare public statement saying it&#8217;s investigating an alleged Chinese plot to plant a spy in the country&#8217;s parliament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia media previously reported that a car dealer surnamed Zhao allegedly was funded by Chinese government to run for a seat in the Federal Parliament. He was found dead in a hotel room in March. There is no conclusion about his death, but the Australian intelligence agency manipulated his relations with China like a tabloid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western media have launched various attacks on China recently, which go beyond reporting but constitute &#8220;a public opinion war&#8221; against China. Western intelligence agencies also stepped in, acting as the manipulator and commander of this public opinion warfare. Relevant institutions in the US, Britain and Australia, members of the &#8220;Five Eyes,&#8221; are involved the most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series of attacks stem from the change in US strategy toward China. These public opinion institutions claimed they are &#8220;independent,&#8221; but are faithfully implementing the US&#8217; new hardline strategy against China. The China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, which is based on mutually beneficial cooperation, has been portrayed as a geopolitical tool and Chinese high-tech giant Huawei, a reform and opening-up pioneer, has become a target of the Western intelligence agencies. China&#8217;s economic rise, which has reshaped the livelihood of 1.4 billion people, is described as an evil movement. They are telling a big lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since all of these are driven by the change of the US&#8217; China strategy, a public opinion war of this kind will become normal. China needs to make long-term preparations. China must raise its voice, deal with the challenge more proactively and effectively. China&#8217;s problem is few institutions want to speak up and they are not good at cooperating with media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take Mike Pence&#8217;s China speech. The US media published a preview of what he would talk about in advance. But when China issues a policy or an important report, government departments wouldn&#8217;t allow media to reveal related information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government departments are the authoritative sources of public information in every country. But Chinese government departments are conservative in providing information, worried about causing trouble for themselves. This is a great regret.</p>
<p>The most effective way to counter US public opinion war against China is to raise our voices while doing our own things well. We must strengthen our ability to expose slander and Western lies. Since the US launched the trade war with China, China has been expanding its openness while fighting back. China&#8217;s image in international trade is becoming increasingly better than the US&#8217; and people can see it.</p>
