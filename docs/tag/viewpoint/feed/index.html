<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit South Korea on Wednesday and Thursday for the first time in five years as the two countries seek to improve ties amid a spat over the installation of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1012594.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD</a>) anti-missile system in South Korea. What is the significance of the visit? What are the stumbling blocks in China-South Korea relations and how to get rid of them? Global Times reporter Yu Jincui talked to two scholars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheng Xiaohe, associate professor with the School of International Studies, Renmin University of China; a senior researcher with the Pangoal Institute</p>
<p>China-South Korea relations are in a transitional period. The ice is melting between the two countries but spring has not yet arrived. The toughest time for bilateral relations has passed, but some problems caused by the deployment of the THAAD system in South Korea remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An urgent task for the two countries is to solve the problems left over by the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1038658.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD deployment</a> while at the same time preventing bilateral ties from being affected by new issues. For instance, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US wants to deploy an intermediate range conventional missile in Asia after the US withdrew from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. There were reports that South Korea has been singled out as a place for the deployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether South Korea hosts the US intermediate-range missile is a potential challenge for China-South Korea relations. Rounds of negotiations between the US and South Korea on sharing the cost of maintaining US troops on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a> have ended without an agreement. The US has piled pressure on South Korea, if the latter doesn&#8217;t compromise over the cost-sharing issue, it might make concessions over other issues such as allowing the US to deploy the intermediate-range missile on its soil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as South Korea has already suffered a lot because of the deployment of THAAD, it would deal with the intermediate-range missile deployment issue very prudently. In the foreseeable future, I believe the chance that it allows the US missile deployment is very slim. One important reason is that once it agrees, it is going to completely ruin China-South Korea relations and have unbearable consequences for Seoul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li Jiacheng, research fellow at the Research Center for the Economies and Politics of Transitional Countries, Liaoning University&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s visit indicates that China-South Korea relations are recovering. It sends out a signal that bilateral ties are going back on track and will continue to move forward. South Korea expects President Xi Jinping to visit Seoul next year and hopes bilateral relations battered by the THAAD row could become normal after Xi&#8217;s visit. Therefore, whether the two countries could pave the way for Xi&#8217;s visit would be on the agenda of Wang&#8217;s two-day trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that Seoul would agree to Washington&#8217;s deployment of intermediate-range conventional missiles on its soil. Compared to THAAD, such missiles are offensive weapons, which will cause greater harm to China&#8217;s strategic security. There is no doubt that China would take stronger countermeasures once South Korea allows the US to deploy the missiles. This is not what South Korea wants to see. Seoul is unwilling to upset the thaw in China-South Korea relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s visit comes amid a simmering row between Japan and South Korea. Japan-South Korea conflicts are still controllable as Seoul has reversed its decision not to renew the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), but further follow up is needed to alleviate tensions. The China-Japan-South Korea trilateral summit is to be held in China this month. China could play a mediating role between South Korea and Japan so as to prevent bilateral conflicts jeopardizing trilateral cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, December is a critical month. In April, it was reported by<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>n media that North Korean leader<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//daily-specials/Where-is-Kim-Jong-un/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un</a> said in a speech he would wait until the end of this year for the US to change its approach to denuclearization talks. It&#8217;s possible Kim would take adventurous steps after the year-end limit, bringing new uncertainties to the Korean Peninsula issue. It&#8217;s particularly important for China and South Korea to conduct strategic communications at this juncture to try to keep North Korea willing to talk to the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg entered the US presidential race last week. The billionaire&#8217;s quest for the White House began with an ad funded by his $31 billion campaign corpus. At a time social media is playing an integral role in US politics, Bloomberg&#8217;s use of television demonstrates how wealth is still the horse that powers the mass media cart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presidential candidates with the strongest grasp of media have shaped the political landscape for some time. In 2007, a junior US senator from Illinois managed to market hope and change to a cynical electorate. Directing campaign staff to spearhead outreach online and offline, then-senator Barack Obama was adept at using the tools of 21st century new media. With backing from Goldman Sachs, it wasn&#8217;t long before the neoliberal politician was able to clinch the Democratic nomination. Obama knew where to focus when selling a political platform in the age of Facebook and Twitter. The &#8220;Yes We Can&#8221; music video propelled the Obama phenomenon.</p>
<p>Distinguishing himself as a candidate against Wall Street recklessness and a critic of &#8220;mind-set that got us into the [Iraq] War,&#8221; his campaign was bolstered when John McCain, then presidential candidate for the Republican Party, picked then Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his vice president. Palin was widely seen as an incompetent candidate after an interview where she seemed unfamiliar with the names of major media outlets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite starting another war in Libya and having an administration made up of career politicians from the Bush and Clinton dynasties, Obama was able to retain the aura of political change when he beat his Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012. Lackluster debate performances lowered his 2012 election margins over Romney, but his campaign&#8217;s mass marketing expertise delivered another four years of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, enter Bloomberg. The unprecedented digitalization of the political landscape has been naturally used to empower the US most privileged sector &#8211; billionaires.</p>
<p>In the 2016 election, US President Donald Trump&#8217;s Twitter account propelled his rise as defined by a Republican primary with over a dozen opponents the media deemed more credible and qualified. Despite losing the popular vote to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Trump could garner about 63 million votes and win the electoral college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s rise was helped by the free airtime he received from news commentators of major cable networks who consistently covered his campaign and its appeal to white nationalists. His tweets then, as they do now, disseminated right-wing fanaticism. Mainstream commentators nonetheless widely publicized them. They emphasized the nature of his viral performance, calling it &#8220;unpresidential,&#8221; instead of spending time accurately covering the proposed policies of other candidates.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s far-right, xenophobic sentiments were acknowledged, but only in the context of the way he communicated them. Racism in past presidential campaigns, such as George H.W. Bush&#8217;s Willie Horton ad or Richard Nixon&#8217;s use of the Southern Strategy, was more discreet. US history shows past presidents, including many Democrats, have implemented many of Trump&#8217;s policies. The difference was that in 2016, a country changed by social media finally had a sobering look at itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this climate, Bloomberg&#8217;s use of traditional media may swing the pendulum away from online platforms. It is certain that Bloomberg, a media mogul, will keep his informational arsenal. Bloomberg News sent a memo to its 2,700 employees telling them not to investigate the former mayor&#8217;s campaign. The network&#8217;s coverage will steer clear of covering Democratic rivals, but focus on Trump, keeping with the practice of mainstream media holding the president&#8217;s spectacle in the spotlight. Spin will play a focal part in Bloomberg&#8217;s media spectacle regardless of how the media he doesn&#8217;t own spin his campaign.</p>
<p>The rest of the media, just like Bloomberg News, will likely ignore the substance of Bloomberg&#8217;s agenda or his record of controversial policies such as the racist stop-and-frisk practice and his support for the Iraq War. Corporate social media will especially generate stories on Bloomberg&#8217;s character as removed from his career. Their algorithms are made for creating a spectacle, and are not meant for principled policy discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social media has taken presidential politics by storm. Facebook has collaborated with Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg&#8217;s campaign while traditional mainstream media outlets openly attack candidates like Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Senator Bernie Sanders for rejecting the Washington Consensus. Sanders has accumulated the most individual donors of any candidate in the Democratic primary but struggles to gain the social media coverage of a front runner. Bloomberg&#8217;s international recognition that arguably predates Sanders&#8217; will likely contribute to that trend. For<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/967085.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/US-election-2016/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US election</a>s, grassroots appeal and a commitment to social justice don&#8217;t determine whether a candidate can clinch the attention of a major newsroom. In the Trump era, building on decades of media deregulation and centuries of political disenfranchisement, Bloomberg&#8217;s candidacy showcases how social media and traditional media work together in the interests of their owners.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, in December 2018, was a turning point in China-Canada relations, which plummeted after the arrest. The time-consuming case touches the nerve of Chinese and Canadian people, and the political fraternity in both countries. The longer the standoff lasts, the harder it will be for relations to be restored to normalcy.</p>
<p>After US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, some Canadian senators followed up by hoping &#8220;the Conservatives will be able to team up with other parties to hold Commons hearings on Hong Kong.&#8221; They wished to make a Canadian version of the US Hong Kong bill and &#8220;enact Magnitsky-style sanctions&#8221; against Chinese mainland and Hong Kong officials responsible for so-called human rights violations.</p>
<p>This shows how Canada&#8217;s lawmakers lack independence when dealing with China-related topics, as they blindly follow the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its attempt to copy the US, Canada has repeatedly made bad calls in trying to bring a thaw in relations with China, despite the fact that tensions with China do not augur well for Canada&#8217;s economic development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though both the Conservative Party and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal Party have shown tough stances toward China, and some Conservatives have attacked Trudeau for being soft on the Asian power, the mainstream attitude toward China within the two parties in the country may not be what media have presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trudeau once said he was unaware of plans to arrest Meng. Obviously he lied. Reports indicated that members of Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal Party had tried to persuade him not to take over the hot potato, but he declined and stubbornly chose to stand with the US in this case. As a result, policies toward China took a beating during his first tenure and are a big reason for him to lose support in the election campaign for the second term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conservative Party said it would be tougher on China, but if it wins power, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily do what it said. In this context, Conservatives&#8217; accusation against Trudeau is more like a strategy to achieve their own political goals by creating trouble for the prime minister over China-related issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both parties&#8217; tough stances on China are actually aimed at getting themselves closer to the US to reap political benefits.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has given the US an opportunity to crack down on Huawei and to contain China, but US pernicious propaganda against China has gradually lost its effect. Some important allies of the US, including Germany, have shown a different attitude toward Huawei. Canada won&#8217;t soon change its attitude toward the Chinese tech company as it follows the US too closely, but it will have to make a choice as the first phase of Meng&#8217;s extradition proceedings is set to begin in January 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the backdrop, it is important for us to continue positive publicity about China and Huawei to counter the effect of lies spread by anti-China politicians from the US and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, we should expand trade connections with Canada, and use trade, people-to-people contacts as well as educational interactions to promote China&#8217;s real image among Canadians. After laying such a foundation of public opinion, the two countries can be persuaded to meet each other halfway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of Meng&#8217;s case, Canada was drawn into the vortex of US-launched trade war against China, and had its economy affected. Hence, bringing China-Canada ties back on track is important for Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast to what Trudeau said that he had &#8220;spent the last four years making things better&#8221; citing increased job creation and lowest unemployment rates in the country&#8217;s history, only 22 percent of Canadians showed strong confidence in his ability to create conditions for economic prosperity, BNN Bloomberg reported, citing a poll by Nanos Research Groups for Bloomberg News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China would be a good way for Trudeau to bring economic prosperity to Canadians as the two countries are highly interdependent in trade with vast potential in trade exchanges. This is what Canadian politicians cannot overlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faced with lack of public trust and dissenting voices from within his Liberal Party and the opposition, Trudeau will have to figure out how to gain more support and govern better in his second term. As China-US trade tensions are slowly mitigating, putting China-Canada ties back on track will not only be a good choice for Trudeau but also be beneficial for his country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opposition attempts to use Hong Kong issue to sow discord in Canadian society but it won&#8217;t affect the big trend of how Canadian government should handle its relations with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese government has shown sincerity and goodwill in terms of Meng&#8217;s case, and Chinese people are looking forward to Canada&#8217;s wise decisions. China and Canada are interdependent in trade, and the two countries should jointly promote globalization to realize win-win cooperation that is in line with their common interests.&nbsp;</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-03/e0e317ae-3ffc-44fb-8ac3-25992f8e9d56.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a routine press conference on Monday that &#8220;the Chinese government decides to suspend reviewing requests of US military vessels and aircraft to visit Hong Kong&#8221; starting from Monday, and &#8220;to impose sanctions on NGOs that played an egregious role in the recent disturbance related to an amendment bill in Hong Kong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement came after US President Donald Trump signed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on November 27. The act interferes in China&#8217;s internal affairs and violates international law and the basic principles of foreign relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the first time China has imposed sanctions on multiple organizations because of their interference in the country&#8217;s domestic affairs. It is by far China&#8217;s most powerful countermeasure against foreign forces on the Hong Kong issue. Although Beijing has not announced specific sanctions, the country has backup plans. The sanctions may be just the beginning and send two signals.</p>
<p>First, by imposing sanctions on NGOs, China has sent a strong warning to other organizations which attempt to interfere in Hong Kong. Second, China has made it clear that it will take real steps, and Washington should not underestimate Beijing&#8217;s resolve to safeguard its national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China had refused to allow US warships to dock in Hong Kong in August. By suspending review of the request by US military vessels and aircraft this time, China has underscored its determination &#8211; If the US does not take China&#8217;s stance seriously, the two countries&#8217; engagements in other fields will be affected. China is telling the US that no country can interfere in China&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>The NGOs slapped with sanctions include the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China has not announced how these NGOs will be sanctioned specifically, it is likely these organizations will be banned from getting involved in any activities in China. The visa applications of the staff of these NGOs may also be rejected. Chinese NGOs and individuals who cooperate with these organizations may be sanctioned. China may also completely cut off any financial transactions of these NGOs in the country, including in Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s sanctions are timely. They repudiate brutal US interference and make relevant US organizations and individuals understand the consequences of interfering in China&#8217;s internal affairs. The sanctions can crush US arrogance.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Hong Kong is concerned, the sanctions are not only a proactive move to stop external interference, but will also have a deterrent effect on the violence by radical rioters. If the rioters continue to create chaos in Hong Kong, the central government will launch tougher measures.</p>
<p>If the US continues to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, China can legislate for its countermeasures in the future. For example, China can draw up a law that opposes any foreign intervention in China&#8217;s internal affairs and punishes the organizations and individuals that stir up troubles in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, China can also keep expanding the sanctions list and add more organizations and individuals, including US senators who are extremely anti-China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Trump administration carries out the provisions of the act, China can impose sanctions on senior US government officials who are in charge of related issues, and delay or cancel the two countries&#8217; dialogues in other areas.</p>

<p>With a total length of more than 8,000 kilometers, the pipeline is the longest natural gas pipeline in the world today. Negotiations alone over the project had been going on for 18 years. But after that, a fruitful result was quickly reached in the following years. Obviously, the process has been encouraged by the strengthening of China-Russia strategic mutual trust.</p>
<p>Once it starts to run at full capacity, the pipeline will be able to supply 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China. This accounts for 14 percent of natural gas that China consumed in 2018 and 28 percent of natural gas that China imported in the same year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, Russian natural gas was mainly delivered to Europe. Russia was supposed not to be worried about relevant exports. However, large-scale US&nbsp; exploitation of shale gas and rapid changes in global energy structure have gradually shaped a buyer&#8217;s market. Combined with the West&#8217;s sanctions against Russia, the latter&#8217;s natural gas exports to Europe face new&nbsp;&nbsp; challenges. Opening up the Chinese market will greatly improve Russia&#8217;s status in negotiations with Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a win-win cooperation between Beijing and Moscow. Strengthening collaboration between the two not only creates substantial quantities of direct benefits, but also often plays a positive role of leverage in their third-party market cooperation.</p>
<p>The comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Russia will benefit the two peoples. To befriend a distant country and be hostile to neighbors has been the usual geopolitical pattern, which is quite common in Asia. In this context, China-Russia ties have set a good example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mutual trust strengthens, the two countries will have more space for trade cooperation. Cross-border pipeline and bridge infrastructure improve the two sides&#8217; all-round cooperation. This will probably structurally affect geo-economics in the entire region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline will economically energize the places it goes through in Russia. For China, many cities will enjoy clean energy from Russia, which will help the environment in Northeast and East China.</p>
<p>China is upholding people-centered development, an idea &#8211; if internationalized &#8211; that maximizes equal and mutually beneficial cooperation among countries. The pipeline benefits the two peoples. There should be more such pipelines and bridges in the world. The mind-set that hinders such projects should be history.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Xisha Islands in the South China Sea Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Two US Navy warships, littoral combat ship USS Gabrielle Giffords and guided missile destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer, trespassed into the waters of the Nansha Islands and the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea on November 20 and 21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two vessels were carrying out the so-called freedom of navigation operations, challenging China&#8217;s sovereignty over the South China Sea. China&#8217;s People&#8217;s Liberation Army Navy conducted the whole-process monitoring and verification on the two US warships and warned them to leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US Navy&#8217;s planned machinations cannot affect peace and stability in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Washington is using increasing tactics to provoke Beijing in the region. Since the US conducted the first so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea in 2012, the US Navy has been increasing their frequency and scale in this regard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest operation is the first time that the US sent a littoral combat ship to carry out a &#8220;freedom of navigation operation&#8221; in the South China Sea, and it is the first time the US challenged China&#8217;s sovereignty in two different areas on two consecutive days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has accused China of so-called excessive maritime claims, including &#8220;requirement that states provide notice or obtain permission prior to innocent passage through territorial sea,&#8221; &#8220;excessive straight baseline claims&#8221; and &#8220;unclear, presumed illegal territorial sea.&#8221; These clichés are Washington&#8217;s explanation of the ambiguities in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea based on US interests. The international community does not accept these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US is trying to disrupt the calm in the South China Sea, which further points to the need of maintaining regional stability there. Recently, countries in the South China Sea have made new progress in regional cooperation. By the end of October, China and the Philippines convened the first meeting of China-Philippines Inter-Governmental Joint Steering Committee on Cooperation on Oil and Gas Development, taking another solid step toward the two countries&#8217; joint maritime development. During the 22nd<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1060150.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-</a><br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> (10+1) leaders&#8217; meeting on November 3, all parties felt encouraged by the progress in talks on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea.</p>
<p>During the ASEAN-US ministerial meeting of the annual ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus on November 17, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned bloc members not to allow the guidelines of the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea &#8220;to be manipulated&#8221; by China. After meeting Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on November 19, Esper said that the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty applies to the South China Sea.</p>
<p>While the current situation in the South China Sea is largely stable and most countries in the region are focusing on cooperation, the US is showing off its military might in the region and hyping up the so-called China threat theory. It is clear which country is maintaining stability and promotion cooperation, and which country is provoking confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington aims to instigate countries in the region to oppose China and to respond proactively to the US Indo-Pacific Strategy. Thus, what the US wants is to turn these countries into pawns to contain its so-called rival, and turns the South China Sea into an area of confrontation.</p>
<p>Countries should cooperate instead of compete in the South China Sea. Maintaining peace and stability in the water depends on joint efforts of countries in the region, and these countries are the biggest beneficiaries of the region&#8217;s long-term security. Thus, certain countries in the region should get rid of their Cold War mind-set, say no to the interference by extraterritorial powers and jointly protect the hard-won stability in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>On the basis of consultation based on equality, countries in the region should improve regional governance mechanism and promote cooperation in various fields including energy exploitation and maritime rescue, so as to improve the well-being of all.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the last workday before Thanksgiving, US President Donald Trump signed on the dotted line of &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,&#8221; which officially put the bill into effect. Radical protesters in Hong Kong were thrilled by it, yet Trump&#8217;s true intention in signing the bill is not about promoting the so-called democracy and freedom in the city, but about considerations of US domestic politics and the upcoming presidential election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The China-US relationship has entered a new period, in which competition between the two is becoming increasingly fiercer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking a hard-line approach toward China is already considered political correctness in US politics &#8211; the House of Representative&#8217;s unanimous approval of the act and the only one vote against it in US Senate is ample proof of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the circumstance, if Trump did not sign the bill, he would have to face&nbsp;criticism from Democrats and mainstream media, which could have led to an internal division among the Republicans. Besides, Trump is still caught up in the impeachment inquiry. Saying no to the act would have further weakened his position in the presidential election. Even if Trump did not give the Hong Kong bill a nod, the act would have automatically taken effect on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another note, Trump is pushing forward a phase one trade deal with China, since economic performance during his presidency is crucial for his future presidential campaign. Signing the Hong Kong bill will definitely make it harder for a trade deal to be reached between Washington and Beijing. This is a trade-off that Trump is fully aware of, and this is also why he suggested in his statement that relevant clauses might not take effect immediately, noting &#8220;my administration will treat each of the provisions of the act consistently with the president&#8217;s constitutional authorities with respect to foreign relations.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump intends to not only leave some room for maneuver in the US-China trade deal, but also to add another chip in the negotiations. Whether China likes it or not, the US-China trade deal now has the Hong Kong issue as a string attached to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act&#8221; represents blatant US interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs. The US is known for its long-arm jurisdiction. Creating domestic laws is one of Washington&#8217;s old tricks to bring down opponents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, since US policymakers raised the idea of the act, it has, to some extent, started to wield its influence, which can be figured out if anyone combines the US law-making process with the ups and downs of the situation in Hong Kong. However, the key issue is how this act will work later. Bills to suppress opponents are always part of the US diplomatic arsenal. The US has many China-related bills, but when and how to use them depends on what the US needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the moment, Washington has several cards to play against Beijing &#8211; the trade war and Hong Kong card are the two that are most potent now. The US deliberately launched the trade war and availed itself of the opportunity to stir up trouble concerning Hong Kong affairs. The trade war is closely connected with China&#8217;s economy and people&#8217;s living standard. Although Hong Kong is still trapped in chaos, it has not yet put China&#8217;s sovereignty and government in danger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these two things have become entwined, thanks to Trump&#8217;s signing of the bill, and can no longer be addressed separately. In addition, Taiwan is gearing up for its &#8220;presidential&#8221; election next year, which will complicate the situation further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faced with the waves of tricky problems, China should deal with them at its own pace. It is crucial to find the connection between different problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But most importantly, the relationship between resolving relevant issues and maintaining overall strategic stability should be made clear. After that, the corresponding plans need to be made. By doing so, China can safeguard its bottom line in this complex situation without being caught in dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>If you have never been to northeastern Guangzhou, capital city of South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, you may have not heard of the Imperial Springs hotel that has a conference center where the Imperial Springs International Forum was held on Sunday and Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been invited to the annual event thrice. This year, participants included 30 former heads of state and government and leaders of international organizations, together with 40 scholars and business leaders as well as over 300 well-known participants.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s forum was &#8220;Multilateralism and Sustainable Development.&#8221; All participants believe multilateralism is the future of mankind and people should have mutual trust, cooperate and open up to one another. I didn&#8217;t doubt the sincerity and concern of participants who are globalists, as the international community is unprecedentedly anxious due to the prevailing environment of unilateralism and protectionism that threaten multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we need more pragmatic steps than mere lip service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past year or two, I have participated in over 10 multilateralism-themed international forums, where I got fed up with the lip service that couldn&#8217;t get the point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, at the Sunday afternoon breakout session focusing on United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and impetus for new era of globalization, I was outspoken in my keynote statement.</p>
<p>I asked, &#8220;Why does no one dare to criticize the US, which is the main country engaging in unilateralism? Why is the international community at its wits&#8217; end after the US has pulled itself out of various treaties and organizations? Why doesn&#8217;t the international community jointly rein in the US international power?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My three questions surprised many of those present and added a tinge of excitement to the tedious breakout session. Then, I continued, &#8220;The 2030 agenda that sets out to achieve the 17 goals including &#8216;no poverty&#8217; and &#8216;zero hunger&#8217; needs clear and feasible mechanism rather than just empty talk.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there should be an incentive mechanism. The international community should award the countries that have made progress in achieving the 17 sustainable development goals. For instance, China has been leading the world in poverty alleviation, but no Chinese scholar or research fellow engaged in working on the goal was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences this year, which was instead shared by two economists with MIT and one with Harvard &#8220;for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, for the countries that have done damage to the 2030 agenda, the international community should set up mechanisms to hold them to account. For example, after the 2008 global financial crisis broke out in the US, it led to the bankruptcy of millions of people worldwide; the US policy has made millions of Syrian refugees go into exile; &#8220;Leaked Pentagon files obtained by the Guardian contain details of more than 100,000 people killed in Iraq following the US-led invasion,&#8221; reported The Guardian in October 2010; US troops have caused heavy casualties in Afghanistan… Why is there nobody that holds the US to account? When I made these points at the forum, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai, who sat opposite me, expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>Third, there should be mechanisms for penalizing violators of the goals. The international community should have punitive measures in place for Western media outlets that file inaccurate reports or even create rumors about the progress of the 2030 Agenda. Most Western media outlets we read are responsible for their negative reports on China. I am worried that when future historians look at Western media&#8217;s reports today, they will find that they ignored and misreported the greatest historical event in the early 21st century &#8211; China&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Many of my friends praised the view. After the forum, a senior UN official told me privately that I had said what he dare not say for years. A young scholar said my speech was uplifting. Many listeners exchanged business cards with me.</p>
<p>I appreciate these friends&#8217; approval. But in the delicate atmosphere of international politics, I seem to be the truth-telling boy in the tale, The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes. In fact, it is difficult to tell the truth.</p>
<p>In the US, there are many lovely people and innovations that are worth learning. Its democratic system was once respected. But the US hegemony is like a Sword of Damocles for all globalists. They do not praise the US hegemony, but they are afraid of criticizing it, because if they do so, it may monitor them, sanction them and even destroy them. Is this the international version of George Orwell&#8217;s dystopian novel 1984?</p>
<p>If there are no moves from the international community to set limits on the US unilateralism, I am afraid all efforts to defend multilateralism will be in vain.</p>

<p>Looking at Africa from the perspective of most international media outlets, one gets the picture of a desperate continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From claims that it is clouded by poverty, illiteracy, insecurity and diseases, one would hardly think of investing in Africa, because in the continent, everything appears hard to crack.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Africa&#8217;s infrastructure has been ailing. It has an inadequate road network that offers poor connectivity, there is paucity of electricity which is costly and ever erratic, while communication networks are still concentrated in urban areas.</p>
<p>The continent&#8217;s social infrastructure is no better as its water supply is limited and sanitation and sewerage coverage is poor. However, significant progress is being made in education and healthcare sectors.</p>
<p>The challenges have ended up hurting Africa&#8217;s growth prospects.</p>
<p>Acknowledging infrastructure is a vital ingredient in its transformation and an enabler for productivity and sustainable economic growth, Africa is investing a huge part of its resources into roads, power connections, water, sewerage lines, and communications.</p>
<p>For example, Ethiopia is building one of Africa&#8217;s largest hydroelectricity plants that promises the continent affordable, reliable and adequate supplies for its industrial needs.</p>
<p>By putting significant amount of resources in sustainable infrastructure, Africa knows too well it would get value for money through greater economic activity, enhanced efficiency and increased competitiveness.</p>
<p>As a result, more countries would be eager to do business with the continent.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that many African countries have already fixed their infrastructure, while others are speedily working on theirs.</p>
<p>South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria, among others, are some of the countries in Africa that have set up stable and friendly platforms for foreign investors to operate from.</p>
<p>No wonder these countries have turned out to be Africa&#8217;s business and investment hubs.</p>
<p>Initially, Africa lagged globally in the buying or selling of products on the internet, famously referred to as electronic commerce, due to lack of internet access, poverty, illiteracy and poor logistics. However, technological advances, which have given millions of Africans access to internet and mobile payment systems, have made it possible for the continent to shed the beggar tag and embrace e-commerce.</p>
<p>Even with its sluggish growth, e-commerce continues to perform reasonably well. In 2017, Africa did online business worth about $16.5 billion. This is forecast to go up to $29 billion by 2022, generating millions of jobs for youth.</p>
<p>But it is the recent coming into force of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement that is likely to turn Africa into an economic nerve center through online shopping. The trade pact, which was signed in Rwanda in March 2018, brings together 54 countries and over 1.25 billion people.</p>
<p>It is in this context that China is boosting its economic cooperation in Africa, aided by the high number of mobile devices and mobile-friendly payment systems such as M-Pesa in Kenya.</p>
<p>So as to make it easy for Africans to conduct business on their mobile phones, some Chinese firms have come up with handsets that match the needs of the continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transsion, the maker of Tecno mobile phones, for instance, has developed affordable, smart gadgets that seldom experience network fluctuations and have a longer battery life in a region where electricity supply is erratic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei and ZTE have also not been left behind in this quest to turn Africa into a technology and communications superhighway with the invention of various communications equipment and software.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal, it appears, is to see Africa follow China&#8217;s footsteps in the e-commerce world. Today, more than 40 percent of the globe&#8217;s e-commerce transactions take place in China as compared to 1 percent about a decade ago.</p>
<p>This growth has been attributed to China&#8217;s mobile payments revolution. However, there were at least 21 million online shoppers in Africa in 2017 or less than two percent of the world total, according to reports. There is hope though, as the continent recorded approximately 21 million online shopping transactions two years ago.</p>
<p>Beyond the setting up of a fertile environment for e-commerce, players in the sector are drawing inspiration from their Chinese counterparts such as Alibaba.</p>
<p>Already, Jumia, Africa&#8217;s upcoming online shopping giant, is seeking commercial cooperation with China to expand sales as recently announced by its management.</p>
<p>Such an engagement and partnership would hasten the digital economy revolution dream in Africa besides enhancing competition that would inspire innovation and lure more Africans to online shopping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of e-commerce would help African countries fight over-reliance on commodities whose prices are prone to market dynamics, generate jobs, help check poverty and ultimately translate to economic growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Germany &#8211; the country&#8217;s ruling party whose former leader is German Chancellor Angela Merkel &#8211; held a conference on November 22 and 23 in Leipzig. The party made decisions on major issues including the candidate selection process and pension reform. Amid complicated international situation and volatile German politics, the CDU conference plays a significant role in German development and clarifies the country&#8217;s role in its future internal and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>However, whether Huawei should be allowed to participate in Germany&#8217;s 5G rollout was one of the most important issues of the convention. It shows the technological issue has been hyped up into one that concerns geopolitics, national security and ideology. It also shows German politicians have huge divergences on the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moderates, represented by Merkel, believe that Germany should not rule out any company over political issues, but focus more on objective factors such as whether its technological security and standards meet German requirements. However, some hard-liners make it an ideological issue and believe Huawei should be excluded. The reason they provided is &#8220;no Chinese company is an independent company,&#8221; adding that Huawei&#8217;s involvement is principally &#8220;an imminent question of national security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merkel has withstood huge pressure and has not budged from her position in the conference. The CDU approved a motion to debate in parliament the involvement of Huawei in building Germany&#8217;s 5G network. But the party also agreed that bidders of German 5G rollout contracts must guarantee the network is free of foreign state influence. This condition is equal for companies from the US, China and all the other countries worldwide. This shows a desire to maintain technological multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a major European mainstream party chooses technological multilateralism and abandons the choices that will further divide the world, it offers proof of its political maturity. This not only benefits Germany&#8217;s interests, but also plays a vital role as a model for other Western countries embroiled in similar issues.</p>
<p>As Merkel said in 2017, Europe has to take its destiny in its own hands. It should not rely too much on the US like it used to. After WWII, the Marshall plan helped Germany&#8217;s economic take-off and made it easier to restore social order. Thus, the US was regarded as the &#8220;liberator&#8221; of Germany. After the German reunification in 1990, the US &#8211; the winner of the Cold War &#8211; was regarded as the &#8220;savior&#8221; who helped reunify Germany. In the internet era, the US is regarded as leading country in many technological areas.</p>
<p>After decades of following the US, Germany has somewhat lost the ability to independently decide its development and destiny. But in recent years, the US has been pursuing unilateralism. The export-oriented German economy is affected by not only China-US trade conflicts, but also US threat of imposing tariffs on German products. Thus, it is time for Berlin to stop its fear of threats from Washington and make choices that are in line with its own interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Germany can strengthen its innovative development and technological cooperation with China through joint works with Huawei. Berlin could also set 5G technological and security standards with Beijing. This will help Germany offset its shortcoming in information and communications technologies and provide foundation for the country&#8217;s political security, economic development and social stability.</p>
<p>There are still some German politicians deeply affected by stereotypes and Western media&#8217;s negative opinions on China. When they talk about China, these people would think of ideological differences first. Although they understand that trade exchanges, technological cooperation and reciprocal China-Germany relations best fit German interests, they feel politically incorrect if they do not talk about so-called democracy, human rights and freedom of speech whenever China is mentioned. Such a mind-set will undoubtedly increase Germany&#8217;s doubts over China and also harm Germany&#8217;s own interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disputes between China and Germany in recent years basically stemmed from some German forces&#8217; accusations over China&#8217;s internal affairs. Chinese officials have never interfered in Germany&#8217;s internal affairs, and never commented on the phenomena like neo-Nazism or the rising wave of anti-Semitism in the country. Instead, China believes the German government and people have the ability to resolve the problems.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, China-Germany relations have a solid and realistic foundation. The two countries can transcend differences in their systems and ideologies, jointly protect multilateralism, set an example of win-win cooperation, stabilize the global situation and bring more hope and benefits to the two peoples and people around the world.</p>
