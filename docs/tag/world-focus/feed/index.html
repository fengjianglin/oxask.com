<p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday that Iran is ready to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia, official IRNA news agency reported. </p>
<p>&#8220;From Iran&#8217;s points of view, there is no problem in developing ties with neighbors and resuming relations with Saudi Arabia,&#8221; Rouhani made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi in Tehran. </p>
<p>&#8220;All the regional countries should stay together in order to create peace and stability in the region,&#8221; Rouhani was quoted as saying. </p>
<p>The Iranian president said that Iran&#8217;s Hormuz Peace Initiative is aimed at bringing regional countries together to create stability. </p>
<p>&#8220;We should establish security in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz through expanding our cooperation and preventing foreign powers to interfere,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Rouhani disclosed the initiative at the recent meeting of the 74th UN General Assembly. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Rouhani said that &#8220;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon failed to bear fruits.&#8221; He urged the Saudi authorities to change their course of action vis-a-vis regional countries. </p>
<p>Rouhani noted that Iran and Saudi Arabia need to leave aside their feud and look ahead to solve regional problems through cooperation.</p>

<p>The Russian Navy will receive more than 480 units of military equipment and armament this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with top defense industry managers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The list includes two submarines, 23 surface ships and support vessels, three aircraft, four coastal missile systems and more than 400 units of various missile and torpedo weapons,&#8221; Putin said.</p>
<p>He added that Russian naval strategic nuclear forces are being re-equipped with modern Borei-class submarines with Bulava ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>According to Putin, the upgraded Borei-A-class submarine Prince Vladimir is undergoing final tests, with four more under construction.</p>
<p>Ships equipped with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles form the basis of the Navy&#8217;s strategic non-nuclear forces, Putin said.</p>
<p>These missiles are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 1,500 kilometers, he said, adding Russia plans to more than double the number of these missiles by 2023.</p>
<p>Putin said that the pace of equipping the fleet with maritime zone ships is accelerating, with the construction of nine surface ships of this class currently underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, we will continue to develop the Navy, making it modern, ocean-going and highly efficient,&#8221; Putin added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />More than 500 Syrian refugees returned on Tuesday to their homeland from Lebanon, the National News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Syrian refugees from different areas in Lebanon, including Burj Hammoud, Tripoli, Bekaa, Nabatieh and other regions, returned to their homeland by bus under the supervision of the Lebanese general security.</p>
<p>More than one million Syrian refugees are registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon, while the Lebanese government estimated the true number of Syrians in the country at 1.5 million.</p>
<p>Lebanese President Michel Aoun has been working hard with the international community to secure the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland due to the negative impact of their stay in Lebanon on the national economy.</p>
<p>The president has previously announced that around 390,000 Syrian refugees have so far returned to Syria.</p>

<p>Spain&#8217;s new parliament met for its opening session Tuesday, with the far-right Vox as the third-largest party following a divisive election that failed to resolve years of deadlock.</p>
<p>Just over three weeks ­after the vote, lawmakers were on Tuesday taking the oath of ­office, although there was little indication of when a government would be formed.</p>
<p>The legislature has been gridlocked since an inconclusive April election which the Socialists won but without a majority &#8211; in an outcome repeated on November 10, leaving Pedro Sanchez a winner but weakened. This time, Vox more than doubled its showing, snaring 52 of the parliament&#8217;s 350 seats.</p>
<p>Just days after the election, Sanchez and the radical left-wing Podemos agreed in principle to form a coalition government in what would be the first such power-sharing deal in the country&#8217;s modern history.</p>
<p>Such a government would only have 155 seats, leaving it dependent on support from other factions to pass an investiture vote for which it would need a minimum of 176.</p>
<p>Sanchez&#8217;s negotiating team began talks with the Republican Left of Catalonia, a Catalan separatist party which won 13 seats in November&#8217;s election but has so far refused to offer its backing. In exchange for support, the party wants talks on the Catalan crisis, which would likely touch on its demand for a referendum on self-determination, an issue completely ruled out by Madrid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chile launched a massive $5.5 billion stimulus package after data showed its economy contracted 3.4 percent in October &#8211; the largest year-on-year drop in a decade &#8211; as widespread social unrest continues.</p>
<p>The package unveiled by ­Finance Minister Ignacio Briones on Monday includes boosting 2020 public spending by $3.03 billion, to support small, medium and large businesses.</p>
<p>Another $525 million are earmarked for other initiatives like the renovation of the metro system in Santiago, which has sustained serious damage since protests erupted on October 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;Estimates show that this agenda will generate 100,000 new jobs next year,&#8221; Briones said.</p>
<p>But the measures will mean a real increase in public spending next year of 9.8 percent as compared to 2019, pushing the fiscal deficit up to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The government announced the stimulus measures after the central bank reported the ­worrisome GDP figures for October.</p>
<p>The 3.4 percent drop was far greater than the 1 percent decrease anticipated in official estimates, and represented the economy&#8217;s worst performance since 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Protests broke out across the country on Monday night, the 46th consecutive day of demonstrations. In Santiago, protesters gathered in the Plaza Italia, a main hub for the city&#8217;s rallies, and dozens of young people broke into different metro stations.</p>
<p>Protests initially erupted in mid-October over metro fare hikes but quickly escalated into the most severe outbreak of social unrest since the end of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.</p>
<p>Furious Chileans have taken to the streets to protest social and economic inequality. Businesses have remained closed during the period of unrest, public transport came to a halt, and many people worked ­shorter days.</p>
<p>At least 23 people have been killed, including five at the hands of security forces, and more than 2,000 were ­wounded.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump on Monday announced plans to re-impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina, hitting back at what he called their &#8220;unfair&#8221; policies.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-03/7e88f8ad-4fa1-4a12-96d4-69fcc7d02107.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Brazil&#8217;s President Jair Bolsonaro (right) meets with US President Donald Trump during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/971038.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G20</a> Summit in Osaka, Japan on June 28. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The move appeared to surprise his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, who considers himself an ideological ally of the Republican leader. Industry leaders in both countries cried foul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies,&#8221; which is hurting American farmers, Trump said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel &amp; Aluminum that is shipped into the US from those countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump last year announced global tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum but later approved exemptions for some countries, including Argentina and Brazil &#8211; after they agreed to quotas.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro sought to play down the issue, saying he would appeal to Trump for more understanding of Brazil&#8217;s position and boasting he has an &#8220;open channel&#8221; with the US leader if needed.</p>
<p>Later, in a radio interview, Bolsonaro said: &#8220;I hope he understands and doesn&#8217;t penalize us in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brazilian leader added he was confident he would receive a favorable hearing from the US president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am almost convinced that he will hear us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For its part, Argentina&#8217;s labor and production ministry said in a statement that it had asked the US for clarification about the announcement and was looking into possible &#8220;joint action&#8221; with Brazil in response.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;Perplexing&#8217; decision&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />
<br />Brazil&#8217;s Steel Institute said it was perplexed by Trump&#8217;s decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no initiative by the government to artificially devalue the Real, and the decision to tax Brazilian steel as a way to compensate American farmers is a retaliation against Brazil, which is inconsistent with the partnership relationship between the two countries,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The decision &#8220;ends up hurting the American steelmaking industry itself, which needs semi-finished products exported by Brazil in order to operate its mills,&#8221; the institute added.</p>
<p>Brazil is the second-largest supplier of steel to the US market behind Canada.</p>
<p>And Brazil and Argentina have benefitted from the US trade war with China, as they have stepped in to replace American exports of soybeans and other agricultural goods to the Asian giant.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro earlier this month met with China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping in Brasilia and said the world&#8217;s second-largest economy was &#8220;becoming more and more part of Brazil&#8217;s future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn before departing for the NATO summit in London, Trump said Brazil had &#8220;devalued their currency very substantially by 10 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he had given Argentina &#8220;a big break&#8221; on tariffs, &#8220;but now I&#8217;m taking that break off. Because it is very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy with what I did,&#8221; Trump added.</p>
<p><strong>Economic impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brazil has teetered on the brink of recession this year, and Argentina is again enmeshed in an economic crisis, which has led to the currencies of both countries weakening against the US dollar.</p>
<p>A weaker currency tends to make exports more competitive, while a stronger US dollar makes foreign goods cheaper for American consumers.</p>
<p>But as the global economy slows, the US dollar tends to strengthen as it becomes a safe haven for nervous investors around the world.</p>
<p>Jose Urtubey, spokesman for Argentina&#8217;s powerful UIA industrial lobby, said producers in the country will be harmed immediately by the tariffs.</p>
<p>With Argentina&#8217;s &#8220;lack of competitiveness&#8221; as a producer, the fact that the United States had the lowest steel and aluminum tariffs was &#8220;beneficial,&#8221; Urtubey said.</p>
<p>The head of Argentina&#8217;s only aluminum producer, Javier Mandanes Quintanilla of the Aluar Group, viewed the tariff plan with trepidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a measure that affects us very strongly,&#8221; he told La Nacion.</p>
<p>The US imported nearly 169,000 tons of steel from Argentina last year, representing more than $220 million in trade.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro&#8217;s right-wing government has promised to revive Brazil&#8217;s flagging economy with a massive stimulus plan, as well as pension and tax reforms, and the central bank has cut the key interest rate more than a dozen times since late 2016.</p>
<p>Trump views those moves as an effort to gain at the expense of the United States.</p>
<p>In his tweets, Trump also called on the Federal Reserve to &#8220;likewise act&#8221; so other nations no longer &#8220;take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid a slowing global economy and the impact of Trump&#8217;s wide-ranging trade offensive, mostly directed against China, the Fed has cut the benchmark interest rates three times this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it has signaled it will stand back before deciding on any further moves.</p>
<p>Despite widespread complaints about the impact of the tariffs on US businesses and consumers, as well as the hit to farmers who have been the target of retaliation from trading partners, Trump claimed in his tweet on Monday that Washington has taken in &#8220;massive amounts of money&#8221; from the tariffs.</p>
<p>American steel has continued to suffer, with overall employment edging downward and production halted at blast furnaces last month. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 48.1 from 48.3 the month before.<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Indian government has decided to undertake a massive outreach plan to reach out to the people to educate them about their fundamental duties, confirmed official sources in the Ministry of Law on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The drive is a part of the year-long celebrations to mark the 70th year of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p>According to the official sources, the center government has contacted the ace law body, the Bar Council of India (BCI), to engage law students for making power-point presentations to schools in their areas educating the young students about their fundamental duties as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p>In a bid to reach out to the masses, there is also a plan to identify as many as 70 eminent personalities in every state and their comments regarding citizens&#8217; fundamental duties would be recorded and promoted through various social media platforms.</p>
<p>A similar exercise would be undertaken by the Ministry of External Affairs which would record statements of various personalities of international fame about the citizens&#8217; fundamental duties and promoted on social media.</p>
<p>The focus of the year-long campaign would be on duties of citizens and motivating them towards duties to the nation, said the official sources.</p>

<br />The Chinese medical mission, which continues to improve the health conditions of Cameroon, is &#8220;a pledge of friendship&#8221; between the two countries, Cameroonian Health Minister Malachie Manaouda said Monday.</p>
<p>Manaouda made the remarks during a ceremony to bid farewell to the 19th Chinese medical mission and welcome the 20th.</p>
<p>Chinese doctors have made &#8220;significant contribution in the care of the Cameroonian populations and in the transfer of knowledge for the benefit of our health personnel,&#8221; Manaouda said.</p>
<p>Wang Yingwu, Chinese ambassador to Cameroon, said that &#8220;the Chinese party is willing to further strengthen cooperation&#8221; with Cameroon in terms of public health in order to implement the health care initiative of the eight major initiatives proposed at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.</p>
<p>The 19th Chinese medical mission, during its one-year term, has treated more than 25,000 patients, performed over 500 surgeries, and traveled nine times to provide free services and medicines to vulnerable populations living in remote areas.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">This image grabbed from a video shows delegates posing for a group photo while attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, Spain, Dec. 2, 2019. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 officially opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. (Xinhua)</p>
<p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement amid unclear prospects and challenges to multilateralism.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began with a warning from Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): &#8220;If we continue as we are doing, we run the risk of increasing the temperature of the planet and that will have an effect and terrible consequences for humanity and threaten our existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not doing enough and we are not even getting close to what we need to do to control this situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the world would need &#8220;solidarity and flexibility to win the war against climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guterres explained that there is only one way to control the temperature of the planet and that was &#8220;limited use of fossil fuels. If we don&#8217;t do that we will end up in a catastrophic situation,&#8221; he warned, before praising the work of young climate activists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young people are telling the leaders that they need to fight against the climate emergency,&#8221; commented the UN chief.</p>
<p>The conference is hosted by the Spanish capital after Chile, which presides over the event, had to step down as host due to social unrest.</p>
<p>Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez welcomed delegates to Spain, saying &#8220;Madrid will be the world capital of the fight against the climate emergency &#8230; But above all we want to be the capital of dialogue between nations united against a common enemy for all humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that although the event was being held in Spain, it is being presided over by Chile. &#8220;This is Chile&#8217;s COP: it is Chile that has organized the leadership and that has worked for an alliance against climate change and the success of this event will belong to Chile.&#8221;</p>
<p>TIME FOR ACTION</p>
<p>The major task for the delegates is to discuss Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the measures to promote voluntary international cooperation by paying a price on carbon, emission trading schemes and other market mechanisms.</p>
<p>The conference comes as global efforts to mitigate climate change are on the brink of failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global contributions to climate change fall far short,&#8221; said Berthold Kuhn, an expert on sustainable development with the Free University of Berlin and senior advisor to the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute.</p>
<p>According to a UN Environment Programme report on the emissions gap published last week, countries have collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.</p>
<p>The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5 percent per year in the last decade. In 2018, emissions totaled 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than the 1.5 degree goal set in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This critical situation has prompted the conference, which will last till Dec. 13, to choose &#8220;Time for Action&#8221; as its motto.</p>
<p>Kuhn believes that market mechanisms should be well designed to stimulate investment in projects like reforestation and other climate-friendly economic activities. Therefore, COP25 is of great importance to implement the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>COOPERATION CRUCIAL</p>
<p>The event comes after the United States formally initiated its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement earlier last month, impacting global cooperation on climate change with its unilateral move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be more difficult for the world to stop climate change by reducing the annual emissions effectively to zero without the United States,&#8221; said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>
<p>World leaders and experts are using COP25 as a venue for promoting multilateralism. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, joined the event on Monday, saying that &#8220;if we work together, we will go faster and we will be as ambitious as possible in the COP negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China&#8217;s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told reporters on Sunday that China will try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,&#8221; said Lu, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success.&nbsp;</p>
