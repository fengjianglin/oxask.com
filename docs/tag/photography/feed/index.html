<p>A photo exhibition will open in Toronto on December 7 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, announced the Canada-China Elite Think Tank Saturday.</p>
<p>A total of 160 photos at the forthcoming show will tell the story of how China has transformed from an underdeveloped country before 1949 into the world&#8217;s second largest economy.</p>
<p>The exhibition will also present a variety of collections featuring Chinese manufacture, poverty alleviation for mankind, unity among ethnic groups, ecological civilization, peaceful development, win-win cooperation and a community with a shared future.</p>
<p>The photo show is sponsored by the Canada-China Elite Think Tank with the help of China Image Group.</p>
<p>Lin Xingyong, chairman of the think tank, told the Xinhua News Agency that the photos will show the true stories of hard-working Chinese people, the glorious achievements of China&#8217;s development and how China has been continuously making great contributions to the world.&nbsp;</p>
