<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />US House Democrats on Tuesday released a draft report summarizing their findings from an ongoing impeachment inquiry into US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The impeachment inquiry, initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in late September, has found that Trump, &#8220;personally and acting through agents within and outside of the US government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection,&#8221; the report claimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There remain unanswered questions, and our investigation must continue,&#8221; according to the 300-page report that also called evidence of Trump&#8217;s alleged misconduct and obstruction of Congress &#8220;overwhelming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, drafted by staff of the Democrat-led House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees, will be transmitted to the lower chamber&#8217;s Judiciary panel, which is expected to take over the impeachment inquiry after the Intelligence panel led by Chairman Adam Schiff voted to issue it this evening.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement in response to the report, accusing it of reflecting nothing more than &#8220;frustrations&#8221; from Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,&#8221; Grisham said. &#8220;Chairman Schiff&#8217;s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump, who&#8217;s in London for a NATO summit, slammed the impeachment inquiry and Schiff earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a disgrace. I think the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves,&#8221; Trump told reporters during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. &#8220;I learned nothing from Adam Schiff. I think he&#8217;s maniac. I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a joint statement following the draft report&#8217;s public release, Schiff and two other Democratic chairs alleged Trump&#8217;s actions &#8220;have damaged our national security, undermined the integrity of the next election, and violated his oath of office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have also challenged the very core of our Constitutional system of checks and balances, separation of powers, and rule of law,&#8221; the Democrats said. &#8220;It will be up to the Congress to determine whether these acts rise to the level of an impeachable offence.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically. Lawmakers are also examining whether the Republican tied a White House meeting or aid for Ukraine to those investigations.</p>
<p>Their report was a result of a fast-moving investigation based on interviews with 17 current and former Trump administration officials who had offered their narratives of the White House&#8217;s handling of its Ukraine policy.</p>
<p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing or a &#8220;quid pro quo.&#8221; The White House has refused to cooperate with the inquiry, accusing Democrats of an unfair process and a partisan attempt to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee unveiled on Monday the four legal experts for its first hearing on Wednesday as part of the Trump impeachment inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry,&#8221; the Committee&#8217;s Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a letter to Trump last week.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat also said they will discuss whether Trump&#8217;s alleged actions &#8220;warrant the House&#8217;s exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor his counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to attend Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. In a letter to Nadler on Sunday, Cipollone said the White House won&#8217;t participate in the hearing, citing concern that the House panel won&#8217;t afford Trump &#8220;a fair process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president will be impeached if the House approves any of the articles of impeachment that the House Judiciary Committee has recommended by a simple majority vote.</p>
<p>But conviction can only happen in the Senate and requires at least two-thirds of its members, or 67 senators, to vote in favorEnditem</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Family members of the victims are in great pain outside the Legal Medical Service, in Taltal, Antofagasta province, Chile, on Dec. 2, 2019. (Xinhua/Edgard Cross-Buchanan/AGENCIAUNO) </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chile launched a massive $5.5 billion stimulus package after data showed its economy contracted 3.4 percent in October &#8211; the largest year-on-year drop in a decade &#8211; as widespread social unrest continues.</p>
<p>The package unveiled by ­Finance Minister Ignacio Briones on Monday includes boosting 2020 public spending by $3.03 billion, to support small, medium and large businesses.</p>
<p>Another $525 million are earmarked for other initiatives like the renovation of the metro system in Santiago, which has sustained serious damage since protests erupted on October 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;Estimates show that this agenda will generate 100,000 new jobs next year,&#8221; Briones said.</p>
<p>But the measures will mean a real increase in public spending next year of 9.8 percent as compared to 2019, pushing the fiscal deficit up to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The government announced the stimulus measures after the central bank reported the ­worrisome GDP figures for October.</p>
<p>The 3.4 percent drop was far greater than the 1 percent decrease anticipated in official estimates, and represented the economy&#8217;s worst performance since 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Protests broke out across the country on Monday night, the 46th consecutive day of demonstrations. In Santiago, protesters gathered in the Plaza Italia, a main hub for the city&#8217;s rallies, and dozens of young people broke into different metro stations.</p>
<p>Protests initially erupted in mid-October over metro fare hikes but quickly escalated into the most severe outbreak of social unrest since the end of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.</p>
<p>Furious Chileans have taken to the streets to protest social and economic inequality. Businesses have remained closed during the period of unrest, public transport came to a halt, and many people worked ­shorter days.</p>
<p>At least 23 people have been killed, including five at the hands of security forces, and more than 2,000 were ­wounded.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientists work on the orbiter vehicle of &#8216;Chandrayaan-2&#8217;, India&#8217;s first moon lander and rover mission planned and developed by the ISRO, in Bangalore, India, 27 June 2019. Photo: IC</p>
<p>NASA made the announcement on Monday, releasing an image taken by its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) that showed the site of the spacecraft&#8217;s impact (September 7 in India and September 6 in the US).</p>
<p>A version of the picture was marked up to show the associated debris field, with parts scattered over almost two dozen locations spanning several kilometers.</p>
<p>In a statement, NASA said it released a mosaic image of the site on September 26 (but taken on September 17), inviting the public to compare it with images of the same area before the crash to find signs of the lander.</p>
<p>The first person to come up with a positive identification was Shanmuga &#8220;Shan&#8221; Subramanian, a 33-year-old IT professional from Chennai, who told AFP that NASA&#8217;s inability to find the lander on its own had sparked his interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had side-by-side comparison of those two images on two of my laptops&#8230; on one side there was the old image, and another side there was the new image released by NASA,&#8221; he said, adding he was helped by fellow Twitter and Reddit users.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite hard, but [I] spent some effort,&#8221; said the self-professed space nerd, finally announcing his discovery on Twitter on October 3.</p>
<p>NASA then performed additional searches in the area and officially announced the finding almost two months later.</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA has to be 100 percent sure before they can go public, and that&#8217;s the reason they waited to confirm it, and even I would have done the same,&#8221; said Subramanian.</p>
<p>Blasting off in July, emerging Asian giant India had hoped with its Chandrayaan-2 (&#8220;Moon Vehicle 2&#8221;) mission to become just the fourth country after the United States, Russia and regional rival China to make a successful moon landing, and the first on the lunar south pole.</p>
<p>The main spacecraft, which remains in orbit around the moon, dropped the unmanned lander Vikram for a descent that would take five days, but the probe went silent just 2.1 kilometers above the surface.</p>
<p>Days after the failed landing, the Indian Space Research Organization said it had located the lander, but hadn&#8217;t been able to establish communication.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign said Monday it was banning journalists from Bloomberg News from its electoral events, claiming &#8220;bias&#8221; by the media group owned by presidential rival Michael Bloomberg.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Michael Bloomberg Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Brad Parscale, the Trump 2020 campaign manager, said the decision was made after Bloomberg News announced it would not investigate the company boss or his Democrat competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;As President Trump&#8217;s campaign, we are accustomed to unfair reporting practices, but most news organizations don&#8217;t announce their biases so publicly,&#8221; Parscale said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events, and will decide &#8220;whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis,&#8221; Parscale added.</p>
<p>Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait said in response: &#8220;The accusation of bias couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump took to Twitter to blast &#8220;Mini Mike&#8221; Bloomberg for the news organization&#8217;s coverage decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat, but to go after President Trump, only,&#8221; the president wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Failing New York Times thinks that is OK, because their hatred &amp; bias is so great they can&#8217;t even see straight. It&#8217;s not OK!&#8221; he added in a swipe at the newspaper after its executive editor condemned the Trump campaign&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s decision to seek the Democratic presidential nomination prompted the news agency, one of the world&#8217;s biggest, to spell out guidelines last week on how it would handle any conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>The media group said it would not investigate Bloomberg&#8217;s family or foundations, nor his Democratic rivals, but would publish or summarize investigative pieces on all Democratic candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy,&#8221; Micklethwait said in a memo to staff last week, citing the company&#8217;s policy of not writing about itself or direct competitors.</p>
<p>Micklethwait said the journalists would cover the campaign&#8217;s news &#8220;in much the same way as we have done before,&#8221; with the exception that articles will explicitly state that Bloomberg News&#8217;s owner is a candidate.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump on Monday announced plans to re-impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina, hitting back at what he called their &#8220;unfair&#8221; policies.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-03/7e88f8ad-4fa1-4a12-96d4-69fcc7d02107.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Brazil&#8217;s President Jair Bolsonaro (right) meets with US President Donald Trump during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/971038.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G20</a> Summit in Osaka, Japan on June 28. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The move appeared to surprise his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, who considers himself an ideological ally of the Republican leader. Industry leaders in both countries cried foul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies,&#8221; which is hurting American farmers, Trump said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel &amp; Aluminum that is shipped into the US from those countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump last year announced global tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum but later approved exemptions for some countries, including Argentina and Brazil &#8211; after they agreed to quotas.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro sought to play down the issue, saying he would appeal to Trump for more understanding of Brazil&#8217;s position and boasting he has an &#8220;open channel&#8221; with the US leader if needed.</p>
<p>Later, in a radio interview, Bolsonaro said: &#8220;I hope he understands and doesn&#8217;t penalize us in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brazilian leader added he was confident he would receive a favorable hearing from the US president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am almost convinced that he will hear us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For its part, Argentina&#8217;s labor and production ministry said in a statement that it had asked the US for clarification about the announcement and was looking into possible &#8220;joint action&#8221; with Brazil in response.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;Perplexing&#8217; decision&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />
<br />Brazil&#8217;s Steel Institute said it was perplexed by Trump&#8217;s decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no initiative by the government to artificially devalue the Real, and the decision to tax Brazilian steel as a way to compensate American farmers is a retaliation against Brazil, which is inconsistent with the partnership relationship between the two countries,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The decision &#8220;ends up hurting the American steelmaking industry itself, which needs semi-finished products exported by Brazil in order to operate its mills,&#8221; the institute added.</p>
<p>Brazil is the second-largest supplier of steel to the US market behind Canada.</p>
<p>And Brazil and Argentina have benefitted from the US trade war with China, as they have stepped in to replace American exports of soybeans and other agricultural goods to the Asian giant.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro earlier this month met with China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping in Brasilia and said the world&#8217;s second-largest economy was &#8220;becoming more and more part of Brazil&#8217;s future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn before departing for the NATO summit in London, Trump said Brazil had &#8220;devalued their currency very substantially by 10 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he had given Argentina &#8220;a big break&#8221; on tariffs, &#8220;but now I&#8217;m taking that break off. Because it is very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy with what I did,&#8221; Trump added.</p>
<p><strong>Economic impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brazil has teetered on the brink of recession this year, and Argentina is again enmeshed in an economic crisis, which has led to the currencies of both countries weakening against the US dollar.</p>
<p>A weaker currency tends to make exports more competitive, while a stronger US dollar makes foreign goods cheaper for American consumers.</p>
<p>But as the global economy slows, the US dollar tends to strengthen as it becomes a safe haven for nervous investors around the world.</p>
<p>Jose Urtubey, spokesman for Argentina&#8217;s powerful UIA industrial lobby, said producers in the country will be harmed immediately by the tariffs.</p>
<p>With Argentina&#8217;s &#8220;lack of competitiveness&#8221; as a producer, the fact that the United States had the lowest steel and aluminum tariffs was &#8220;beneficial,&#8221; Urtubey said.</p>
<p>The head of Argentina&#8217;s only aluminum producer, Javier Mandanes Quintanilla of the Aluar Group, viewed the tariff plan with trepidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a measure that affects us very strongly,&#8221; he told La Nacion.</p>
<p>The US imported nearly 169,000 tons of steel from Argentina last year, representing more than $220 million in trade.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro&#8217;s right-wing government has promised to revive Brazil&#8217;s flagging economy with a massive stimulus plan, as well as pension and tax reforms, and the central bank has cut the key interest rate more than a dozen times since late 2016.</p>
<p>Trump views those moves as an effort to gain at the expense of the United States.</p>
<p>In his tweets, Trump also called on the Federal Reserve to &#8220;likewise act&#8221; so other nations no longer &#8220;take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid a slowing global economy and the impact of Trump&#8217;s wide-ranging trade offensive, mostly directed against China, the Fed has cut the benchmark interest rates three times this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it has signaled it will stand back before deciding on any further moves.</p>
<p>Despite widespread complaints about the impact of the tariffs on US businesses and consumers, as well as the hit to farmers who have been the target of retaliation from trading partners, Trump claimed in his tweet on Monday that Washington has taken in &#8220;massive amounts of money&#8221; from the tariffs.</p>
<p>American steel has continued to suffer, with overall employment edging downward and production halted at blast furnaces last month. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 48.1 from 48.3 the month before.<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Former US President Jimmy Carter has been admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection, a spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>The 95-year-old longest-living former US president was admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, southeast US state of Georgia, this past weekend for treatment of the urinary tract infection, according to the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon. We will issue a statement when he is released for further rest and recovery at home,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Carter was discharged after undergoing a surgery earlier in November to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding due to recent falls.</p>
<p>The 39th US president serving between 1977 and 1981 oversaw the normalization of diplomatic ties between the United States and China 40 years ago.</p>

<p>As many as 21 people were killed after a passenger bus plunged into a ravine in northern Chile, local authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The accident, which occurred late Sunday near Taltal, a community in Antofagasta province, left another 20 people injured, Taltal prosecutor Ricardo Castro told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give the community the tranquility of knowing that we are going to carry out all the necessary investigations to determine the identity of the person or persons responsible for the incident,&#8221; said Castro.</p>
<p>The double-decker bus had departed from the town of Antofagasta around 8:30 p.m.local time (2330 GMT) on its way to Ovalle with some 50 passengers on board.</p>
<p>According to reports, the bus was traveling along an alternative route to the highway in order to save time and the driver lost control of the vehicle at a point where the road slopes.</p>
<p>Chilean President Sebastian Pinera expressed his &#8220;deep&#8221; regret for the loss of lives in a message on Twitter.</p>
<p>The injured were taken to area hospitals for treatment.&nbsp;</p>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 officially opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. (Xinhua)</p>
<p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement amid unclear prospects and challenges to multilateralism.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began with a warning from Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): &#8220;If we continue as we are doing, we run the risk of increasing the temperature of the planet and that will have an effect and terrible consequences for humanity and threaten our existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not doing enough and we are not even getting close to what we need to do to control this situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the world would need &#8220;solidarity and flexibility to win the war against climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guterres explained that there is only one way to control the temperature of the planet and that was &#8220;limited use of fossil fuels. If we don&#8217;t do that we will end up in a catastrophic situation,&#8221; he warned, before praising the work of young climate activists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young people are telling the leaders that they need to fight against the climate emergency,&#8221; commented the UN chief.</p>
<p>The conference is hosted by the Spanish capital after Chile, which presides over the event, had to step down as host due to social unrest.</p>
<p>Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez welcomed delegates to Spain, saying &#8220;Madrid will be the world capital of the fight against the climate emergency &#8230; But above all we want to be the capital of dialogue between nations united against a common enemy for all humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that although the event was being held in Spain, it is being presided over by Chile. &#8220;This is Chile&#8217;s COP: it is Chile that has organized the leadership and that has worked for an alliance against climate change and the success of this event will belong to Chile.&#8221;</p>
<p>TIME FOR ACTION</p>
<p>The major task for the delegates is to discuss Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the measures to promote voluntary international cooperation by paying a price on carbon, emission trading schemes and other market mechanisms.</p>
<p>The conference comes as global efforts to mitigate climate change are on the brink of failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global contributions to climate change fall far short,&#8221; said Berthold Kuhn, an expert on sustainable development with the Free University of Berlin and senior advisor to the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute.</p>
<p>According to a UN Environment Programme report on the emissions gap published last week, countries have collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.</p>
<p>The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5 percent per year in the last decade. In 2018, emissions totaled 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than the 1.5 degree goal set in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This critical situation has prompted the conference, which will last till Dec. 13, to choose &#8220;Time for Action&#8221; as its motto.</p>
<p>Kuhn believes that market mechanisms should be well designed to stimulate investment in projects like reforestation and other climate-friendly economic activities. Therefore, COP25 is of great importance to implement the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>COOPERATION CRUCIAL</p>
<p>The event comes after the United States formally initiated its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement earlier last month, impacting global cooperation on climate change with its unilateral move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be more difficult for the world to stop climate change by reducing the annual emissions effectively to zero without the United States,&#8221; said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>
<p>World leaders and experts are using COP25 as a venue for promoting multilateralism. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, joined the event on Monday, saying that &#8220;if we work together, we will go faster and we will be as ambitious as possible in the COP negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China&#8217;s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told reporters on Sunday that China will try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,&#8221; said Lu, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump slammed an ongoing impeachment inquiry into him on Monday, as the next phase of the high-stake investigation was drawing near.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters outside the White House before leaving for a trip to London to attend a NATO summit, Trump called the impeachment inquiry &#8220;a hoax,&#8221; while accusing Democrats of doing &#8220;an absolute disgrace&#8221; to the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the Democrats, the radical-left Democrats, the do-nothing Democrats, decided when I&#8217;m going to NATO &#8211; this was set up a year ago &#8211; that when I&#8217;m going to NATO, that was the exact time,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;This is one of the most important journeys that we make as president.&#8221;</p>
<p>The impeachment inquiry into the president, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated in late September, will enter a new phase this week as the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Democrat Jerry Nadler, is slated to hold its first hearing on Wednesday on &#8220;constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legal scholars will provide testimony to the panel on that day as Democrats are considering whether the evidence turned up in their weeks-long impeachment inquiry warrants the drafting of articles of impeachment against Trump.</p>
<p>In a letter to Nadler on Sunday, White House counsel Pat Cipollone said they will not participate in Wednesday&#8217;s hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot fairly be expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will afford the President a fair process through additional hearings,&#8221; Cipollone wrote. &#8220;Accordingly, under the current circumstances, we do not intend to participate in your Wednesday hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically. Lawmakers are also examining whether the Republican tied a White House meeting or aid for Ukraine to those investigations.</p>
<p> <br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Trump has denied any wrongdoing or a &#8220;quid pro quo.&#8221; On Monday, he shared a link on Twitter of an interview that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had with U.S. magazine Time so as to defend his narrative.</p>
<p>In that interview, Zelensky said he &#8220;never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not my thing,&#8221; Zelensky continued. &#8220;If you&#8217;re our strategic partner, then you can&#8217;t go blocking anything for us. I think that&#8217;s just about fairness. It&#8217;s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>The House Intelligence Committee concluded its public hearings prior to the Thanksgiving recess after it heard testimony from a series of current and former Trump administration officials and has spent the Thanksgiving recess drafting a report of its findings.</p>
<p>Lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee are expected to begin reviewing a draft version of the report Monday evening and will vote at a business meeting Tuesday on whether to adopt the report, which would be sent to the House Judiciary Committee thereafter.</p>
<p>The White House has refused to cooperate with the investigation, accusing Democrats of an unfair process and a partisan attempt to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election. Several senior administration officials have refused to testify, and multiple agencies have stonewalled Democratic requests for documents and communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during a press conference at the National Palace, in Mexico City, capital of Mexico, on June 3, 2019. (Xinhua/Francisco Canedo)</p>
<p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Sunday that former Bolivian leader Evo ­Morales was the &#8220;victim of a coup d&#8217;état.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leftist president, nicknamed AMLO, celebrated his first year in office with a speech to throngs of supporters in Mexico City.</p>
<p>While detailing budget and tax policies, and the ongoing fight against corruption, Lopez Obrador touched on Mexico&#8217;s foreign policy by recalling his government&#8217;s decision to accept Morales as an asylum seeker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evo was the victim of a coup d&#8217;état! And from Mexico, we tell the world, &#8216;Yes to democracy, no to militarism!'&#8221; Lopez Obrador said during the&nbsp;rally in the central Plaza del Zocalo.</p>
<p>The square was packed with people, and musical groups performed alongside Lopez Obrador&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p>It also marked the first time that Lopez Obrador, who has been in office for a year, spoke directly about the ­circumstances that led to ­Morales&#8217; departure from Bolivia.</p>
<p>Morales resigned on November 10 amid swelling protests over what political opponents said was his rigging of&nbsp;October 20 elections.</p>
<p>He fled to Mexico the following day after losing the support of the military and police, claiming to be the victim of a coup.</p>
<p>While echoing Morales&#8217; claim on Sunday, Lopez Obrador called the exiled leader &#8220;our brother, who represents with dignity the majority of indigenous people of Bolivia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morales has yet to meet publicly with Lopez Obrador. He was welcomed on arrival to Mexico by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard.</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador&#8217;s one-year anniversary was marred by a shootout Saturday afternoon near the US border between suspected drug traffickers and police, leaving 20 dead.</p>
<p>Shooting continued into ­early Sunday, and authorities said that four of those killed were police, 14 were suspected criminals and another three bodies were unidentified.</p>
<p>The shootout came after Lopez Obrador warned he would not allow the US to conduct cross-border armed operations against drug cartels in the country.</p>
