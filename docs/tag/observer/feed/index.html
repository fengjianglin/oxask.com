<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Chinese mobile phone users have been required to submit their facial recognition scans to verify their identity when applying for new phone numbers, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a>. The new rule took effect on Sunday, and triggered much attention from the international community. Many Western media accused the rule of violating human rights, and some even said that China has taken another step toward a &#8220;dystopian surveillance state.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is the most important human right? It might be security. Facial recognition and the real-name system are currently the most effective ways to crack down on telecommunications fraud and identity theft. These measures have successfully protected the personal and property security of Chinese mobile phone users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has become one of the countries with the fastest development of facial recognition, but some Western media have been using the clich√© of human rights to attack China. They have not realized that the convenience and security brought by the new technology are also a guarantee of human rights.</p>
<p>For example, some people have blackened China&#8217;s use of surveillance products including facial recognition and big data analysis in Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, saying they violate the human rights of the people in the region. However, these products are meant to detect terrorists and protect ordinary people, and facial recognition has played an important role in countering terrorism and bringing peace back to Xinjiang. Isn&#8217;t this a great explanation of human rights?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, China is not the only country that uses facial recognition and surveillance cameras. These have been adopted by many countries to maintain social security and stability. In October, France reportedly used facial recognition to give its citizens digital identities. As early as 2011, there had already been a network of almost 2 million surveillance cameras in the UK, according to The Guardian&#8217;s report. But why do some Western media hype only China&#8217;s use of facial recognition and surveillance cameras? The Western double standards are way too obvious.</p>
<p>We need to admit that facial recognition has faced some technological controversies. For example, some argue that facial recognition will leak personal information and affect the security of people&#8217;s biological information. It is true that any identification technology should regard users&#8217; rights as a priority.</p>
<p>However, China has been constantly regulating the use of facial recognition.</p>
<p>In November, China set up a national-level working group to set standards for the country&#8217;s first facial recognition regulation. The group consists of 27 prominent Chinese companies, including Tencent and iFlytek, and aims to promote China&#8217;s governance in artificial intelligence and boost the sound development of the industry.</p>
<p>The development of new technology is unstoppable. Instead of accusing China of putting so-called electronic anklets on Chinese people, Western media should see that China has been exploring the boundaries of the rules of new technology. Such exploration can also be a reference for other countries. Some Western countries should not ignore or even blacken China&#8217;s efforts.</p>

<p>NATO&#8217;s 70th anniversary meeting is scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday in London. Troubled by internal and external problems, the organization seems not in a mood to celebrate. The US-based Defense News even predicts that &#8220;politics could make the situation feel more like a funeral.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization is already dragged by several internal disputes such as defense budgets, and is also frustrated by external challenges, including the Middle East situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even so, Washington still seemingly considers NATO not in enough trouble and has recently started to find the organization a new enemy &#8211; Beijing.</p>
<p>On November 20, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for member states&#8217; attention to the &#8220;current and potential long-term threat&#8221; posed by China at a NATO foreign ministerial meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A senior US administration official again said Friday that the China-posed challenges, including its &#8220;dominance of 5G telecommunications networks&#8221; is a &#8220;very, very high priority&#8221; and will be discussed by President Donald Trump with allies at the NATO summit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US is building NATO as an ideology-based alliance aimed at containing China, with 5G as its major focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his European visit in September, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged NATO members to ban Chinese companies from their 5G networks. Similar statements have been made by quite a few US officials.</p>
<p>NATO has always been a tool utilized by Washington to support its own interests. The US is now attempting to draw other countries over to its side and pursue its strategic goal of keeping China down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Europe should not be fooled by US tricks. It is time for these member states to seriously consider the situations and make the right choice.</p>
<p>European nations are now faced with two options: blindly following the US or cooperating with China despite US preaching.</p>
<p>Taking sides with the US is not in line with Europe&#8217;s interests. Making this choice will only turn Europe, a significant world polar, into a US puppet. Is this a scenario the once strongest continent wants to see? And if European countries shut their door on China&#8217;s 5G technology, will they be able to bear the potential losses?</p>
<p>But recognizing the reality and cooperating with China will make a different story. In 2018, China was the second-largest partner for EU exports and the largest partner for EU imports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future cooperation will only bring more benefits to both sides. It is possible that the US will create difficulties for China-Europe collaboration, but China is ready to make efforts to strengthen exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facing the two choices, those with discerning eyes can easily tell which to choose. &#8220;Is our enemy today Russia? Or China? Is it the goal of NATO to designate them as enemies? I don&#8217;t believe so.&#8221; French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> has already made this clear.</p>
<p>What good does making an enemy do? Targeting China is a doomed way, as breaking off cooperation with the world&#8217;s second-largest economy is like self-imposed isolation. Europe should think it over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thirty-seven Asia-Pacific countries on Friday voted to adopt the Asia-Pacific Declaration on Advancing Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s Empowerment: Beijing+25 Review, an outcome that was hoped to be a consensus document but received last minute objections from the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed human rights defender, the US has flaunted its efforts in advancing gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment but has finally stood against the world by refusing to vote in favor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US wanted to remove any reference to sexual and reproductive health rights, particularly abortion, which it said it does not recognize as a form of family planning,&#8221; the Philippine-based ABS-CBN reported.</p>
<p>The US move surprised many, including its allies Australia and New Zealand, which expressed their disappointment publicly. However, if we thoroughly look back to what the US has done in allegedly promoting women&#8217;s rights, we find the move in line with the country&#8217;s real values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past year, lawmakers in states across the US hypocritically legislated to protect fetal rights and restrictively banned abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with the only exception for a serious threat to the health of the woman. Just as the author of a New York Times article headlined &#8220;A woman&#8217;s rights,&#8221; wrote: &#8220;More and more laws are treating a fetus as a person, and a woman as less of one‚Ä¶&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The absurdity reflects how conservative US forces represented by the Republicans have torn off their disguise of neoliberalism and showed what they really are: a group of evangelical elites who want to achieve moral satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is that US women are subject to long-term, systematic, extensive and systematic discrimination, which is quite shocking.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s largest economy, the US has failed to protect the rights of women in the economic sphere. They face seriously discrimination in terms of employment, wages and careers. As nearly half of labor in the country, US women suffer higher unemployment than men: Between October 2016 and October 2017, US women lost more than 160,000 jobs while some 106,000 new jobs were added for men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The income gap between the two genders is huge, and due to the problem of social welfare, retired women are more likely to fall into poverty than retired men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to economic inequality, US women have suffered from sexual harassment and violence in the workplace, school and at home &#8211; with black women the biggest victim, 45 percent of whom were physically or sexually abused. In the meantime, African-American women and children face a higher death rate than white Americans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gender discrimination is deeply rooted in US society, and patriarchy and a flawed social system have made it hard to be effectively uprooted. US women have struggled for equality for dozens of years but couldn&#8217;t even get the right to vote until 1920 &#8211; over 100 years after the foundation of the self-professed &#8220;most free and democratic&#8221; country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s human rights are indispensable for universal human rights. How women enjoy their rights is an important criterion to measure a country&#8217;s human rights situation. A serious violation of women&#8217;s rights has not only intensified US society&#8217;s inequality but also hindered the cause of international human rights from developing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has been adopting a double standard on human rights. It acts like a clown that swings human rights as a stick to beat other countries, repeatedly revealing its ill-intentioned political motive.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>China&#8217;s State Council Information Office released an annual report titled &#8220;China&#8217;s Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change (2019)&#8221; on Wednesday. The report said China has basically reversed the situation of the country&#8217;s rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on Tuesday released its Emissions Gap Report 2019, saying greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the last decade. The report said, &#8220;Despite contributing significantly to the slowdown in global emissions from 2014 to 2016,&#8221; China&#8217;s emissions are now rising again.</p>
<p>But the UN should see that although China&#8217;s emissions are rising, the trend of rapid growth has been reversed. Despite the recent rebound in China&#8217;s coal power demand, China has adhered to a clean coal power supply system with strict standards. China is marching toward its target of net zero emissions, but this needs to be gradually accomplished.</p>
<p>China has been actively dealing with climate change and taking responsibility as a major power. This is completely different from the US stand. Since Chinese Premier Li Keqiang &#8220;declared war&#8221; on pollution in 2014, China has been improving its industrial efficiency and increasing investment in renewable energy. China has also been fulfilling its promises under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. These are all outstanding accomplishments that should be applauded.</p>
<p>But it seems that the US has not shouldered its obligations at all. In the UNEP report, the US greenhouse gas emission per capita in 2018 was still much higher than that of the global average. In early November, US President Donald Trump formally started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement. Trump also skipped a session devoted to climate change at the G7 summit in August, saying that he is not going to lose the &#8220;tremendous wealth&#8221; of the US &#8220;on dreams&#8221; and &#8220;on windmills.&#8221;</p>
<p>But can that &#8220;tremendous wealth&#8221; help the US escape the extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide? No. In January, extreme cold weather hit Midwestern US, causing tens of deaths and many frostbite victims. In July, millions of Americans suffered from a dangerous and widespread heat wave, leading to power outages in the country. Such extreme weather not only hurts people, but also costs US companies more for repairs. Right now that climate change also harms the US economy. Is the Trump administration still not going to do anything about it? No country is an island when facing climate change. If the US insists on caring about nothing but its own short-term interests, it will be ruining its own future as well as that of others.</p>
<p>China-US cooperation has faced many difficulties after Trump assumed office. But the two countries still have opportunities to cooperate on climate change and many other hot global issues. As the 25th UN Climate Change Conference will be held in Spain on Monday, we hope the US, as a superpower and the largest economy, can meet China halfway on climate change.</p>
<p>China and the US have the common need to deal with climate change. The two countries now have different understandings of their responsibilities, but the Trump administration still should understand that when facing extreme weather, cooperation is the only way out. This is not only for the sake of the American people, but more importantly, for the future of mankind.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>To refute US fears that Huawei would send sensitive data records to the Chinese government, German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier said on Sunday that &#8220;Germany still did not impose any boycott&#8221; on the US despite the US National Security Agency&#8217;s surveillance of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell hysterically fought back by saying that equating the US government action with that of the &#8220;Chinese Communist Party&#8221; was &#8220;an insult&#8221; to the US troops who &#8220;help ensure Germany&#8217;s security&#8221; and &#8220;the millions of Americans committed to a strong Western alliance.&#8221; He said there is &#8220;no moral equivalency&#8221; between China and the US.</p>
<p>First of all, Grenell&#8217;s remarks were an insult to China and the 1.4 billion Chinese people. It was an extreme statement full of discrimination against another kind of value, race and civilization. Indeed, it is not equivalent to compare China with a hegemonic and inconsistent government full of double standards.</p>
<p>Grenell was also insulting and despising Germany and Europe by forcing European countries to choose sides between China and the US. Washington has been forcing Europe to divide on many issues, and this is completely against European countries&#8217; interests. More and more countries have seen US double standards: While the US is hyping Huawei&#8217;s unfounded spying concerns, it is also spying on its European allies. As time passes by, fewer countries will follow the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US will insist on targeting Huawei worldwide. However, Germany&#8217;s reaction shows that the results may not be as optimistic as the US had expected. During the Christian Democratic Union of Germany&#8217;s convention on Friday and Saturday, Merkel said Germany should not rule out any company due to political problems. Indeed, countries should focus more on objective factors, such as companies&#8217; technological security and standards, instead of ideology or political system.</p>
<p>Despite US provocation of China-Europe relations, China is determined to promote relations with Europe. For example, Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> expressed on November 6 their support for early conclusion of an ambitious and balanced China-European Union investment agreement. Many leaders from Central and Eastern European countries have expressed their will to deepen cooperation with China. As Merkel said in 2017, Europe has to take its destiny in its own hands.</p>
<p>China has never told Europe to follow China&#8217;s steps and fight the US. It is the US that has been trying to rope in European countries to oppose China. Washington should not turn Europe into a battlefield of China-US disputes. This is contempt for Europe.</p>
<p>It seems that some US politicians can never get rid of their Cold War mind-set. But 21st century conditions are different from those in the Cold War era, and today&#8217;s China is not like the Soviet Union decades ago. China is not a threat to any country. China and Europe are victims of US hegemony and protectionism, and neither of them can bear multilateralism breaking down. When facing the US government&#8217;s words and deeds, China and Europe must jointly maintain the free and open global investment environment to deal with the challenges.</p>

<p>US Republican Senator Ted Cruz is creating trouble again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anti-China senator is planning to propose a bill called &#8220;Taiwan Symbols of Sovereignty Act,&#8221; which aims to &#8220;peel back some of the extreme insults of Taiwanese that are inflicted by the one-China policy protocol,&#8221; such as the ban of Taiwan&#8217;s &#8220;officials&#8221; from visiting US government agencies, and prohibiting the island&#8217;s exchange students at West Point from wearing the uniform of their own &#8220;military.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scheme was made public by Christian Whiton, former senior adviser in the Trump and Bush administrations, on Friday at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. Whiton added, &#8220;I hope this will be a good start.&#8221; Cruz has long been hostile to China and has slammed the Asian country on various issues. But even if all his past misdeeds can be forgotten, it is totally unacceptable that he is now advocating Taiwan&#8217;s &#8220;sovereignty&#8221; and zeroing in on relevant legislation. This is a grave challenge to China&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.&#8221; This is the US declaration on record, written explicitly in the Shanghai Communiqu√© signed by China and the US in 1972.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the eyes of certain US politicians like Cruz and Whiton, the one-China policy has inflicted &#8220;extreme insults&#8221; to Taiwan citizens and set restrictions for the US, but it is exactly this policy that has helped maintain stable China-US ties over the past 40 years. Once Cruz&#8217;s ridiculous bill is passed, it would be an overt violation of Washington&#8217;s own words, would cast all his predecessors&#8217; efforts to the wind, and lead to disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>China must be and will be reunified &#8211; this is Beijing&#8217;s persistent position. China has already made it clear that &#8220;if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all cost for national unity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill is a bare provocation. Anyone who challenges China&#8217;s core interests must pay a heavy price. Once Cruz&#8217;s proposal becomes a concrete policy, the US will certainly be placed in a dangerous situation. If US politicians continue to interfere in the Taiwan question, they will eventually draw fire against themselves. The worst-case scenario could even be a termination of the US-led order in Asia.</p>
<p>Politicians like Cruz reflect the decline and inefficiency of US politics. They are like clowns performing burlesques on the world power&#8217;s political stage. The worst is that Cruz and his likes are good at mobilizing public opinion, but lack basic history knowledge. If Cruz understands a little about the Korean War in the 1950s, he will figure out how much the powerful US paid for underestimating China&#8217;s determination.</p>
<p>The proposal might indeed be a &#8220;start,&#8221; as Whiton hopes, but one of disasters. Cruz and his colleagues had better ask if the Pentagon is well prepared.</p>

<p>There is a group of academic elites in the US who have kept a close watch on the situation in Hong Kong. These so-called scholars insist on the supremacy of their Western values and refuse to acknowledge the fact that China&#8217;s system is more suitable to its current situation &#8211; particularly after China repeatedly dismissed their conspiracy theories on it. They feel discomfort and try to vent their anger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since US President Donald Trump had threatened to veto the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights Democracy Act, they came out to voice their support for the bill and condemned their democratically elected president for failing the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian Whiton, a senior fellow at the Center for the National Interest and former adviser to the Trump administration, said on Friday that it would be foolish if Trump does not sign the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shows people coming from behind the scene to the stage. In the 1920s, Edward Bernays, who is widely regarded as father of public relations and propaganda, outlined how to control what people think. His theory was believed to be the origin of the &#8220;color revolution&#8221; concept. Some American scholars may have followed Bernays&#8217; theory and played an important role in the current Hong Kong unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These people have taken Hong Kong and Taiwan as &#8220;fortresses&#8221; and &#8220;experiment fields&#8221; of democracy. Together with Washington, they use the two places as leverage to contain China, and infiltrate education and social groups of Hong Kong with their thinking and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some US academic institutions and foundations, such as the Washington DC-based National Endowment for Democracy (NED), regard Hong Kong as a laboratory and have done so-called experiments, in addition to funding local organizations to preserve so-called democratic rights &#8211; in line with the protests &#8211; and help organize training seminars for scholars, lawyers and civil servants.</p>
<p>For instance, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions &#8211; the city&#8217;s second-largest labor group that supported the &#8220;umbrella movement&#8221; in 2014 &#8211; has reportedly received donations from the NED worth about $2 million in the past two decades.</p>
<p>According to a conference paper issued by the Boston-based think tank National Bureau of Economic Research in June, some researchers have &#8220;indirectly incentivized&#8221; Hong Kong university students to participate in the July 1 marches in 2017 and 2018 for &#8220;scientific purposes,&#8221; and paid them up to HK$ 350 ($45) for individual surveys. Nearly 850 subjects completed all four study waves.</p>
<p>The escalating violence in the city excited these US elites and also worried them. They were excited to see their anticipated so-called democratic movement taking place in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, they were worried they would miss the precious chance to advocate their political ideas and actively support the US government while violating international norms by intervening in China&#8217;s domestic affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the unrest escalates in Hong Kong, they have completely removed their academic veneer and showed their true anti-China intentions. We have become clearer about what they are really up to. But as it had happened several times in the past, their evil intentions will eventually collapse amid China&#8217;s steady pace forward.</p>

<p class="Bodytext1stpara">
<p>German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom will gradually phase out Huawei components from its core network as part of the routine replacement of equipment, Wirtschaftswoche, a German weekly business news magazine, reported on Wednesday. Chinese Ambassador to Germany Wu Ken said the same day that Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s move would send a protectionist message.</p>
<p>Excluding Huawei from Germany&#8217;s 5G network construction is groundless discrimination against Chinese companies. If Huawei really has technological and security issues, we may accept Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s decision. But the fact is there has been no evidence to date that proves Huawei threatens other countries&#8217; cyber security. Germany&#8217;s reasons to ban Huawei don&#8217;t hold water.</p>
<p>Many high-ranking German officials have misunderstandings and prejudice against Huawei. Bruno Kahl, president of Germany&#8217;s Federal Intelligence Service, said Huawei cannot be trusted because Huawei is &#8220;a state company that has a very high level of dependence&#8221; on the Communist Party of China and China&#8217;s intelligence agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Huawei has repeatedly said it is not a state-owned enterprise, but a private company that has nothing to do with China&#8217;s national security agency. Some German anti-China hawks have been stubborn. They have made a conclusion on Huawei without even trying to understand the situation.</p>
<p>The European Union recently proposed a concept called digital sovereignty. Indeed, each and every country values its digital sovereignty. The problem is the rules and regulations these countries form on the issue and the fairness and equality of the rules. It seems Germany has not treated Huawei in a fair and reasonable way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei is always willing to follow and has been strictly following the laws of the countries concerned. However, some German companies believe Huawei has violated the law just because they think Huawei has a close relationship with Chinese authorities. This will seriously harm Germany&#8217;s own rule of law. To choose or not to choose Huawei should have been a market choice, but it has almost become a political choice in many countries and regions. And it is the US that has forced such a political choice on them.</p>
<p>Although the concerns of Huawei&#8217;s potential security risks have been rising in Germany, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has decided not to formally exclude the Chinese company from Germany&#8217;s 5G construction. But some do not agree with Merkel, and German officials have not reached a consensus on Huawei. We hope Germany can treat Huawei equally from the perspective of international norms and the market economy.</p>
<p>We are aware that some people in Germany are deeply influenced by the US Cold War mind-set. However, these people should understand that any ban on Huawei for political reasons or another country&#8217;s pressure will harm China-Germany relations. Hopefully, these people see that in the context of globalization, cooperation between China and Germany is a general trend.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s move is against the rules of the market economy. If German companies set political standards and ban Huawei for political reasons, China will not sit idly and ignore it.</p>

<p>A CNN&#8217;s article entitled &#8220;China has saved hundreds of thousands of lives by reducing air pollution, study says,&#8221; published on Tuesday, discusses achievements China has made in its fight against environmental problems. CNN also offered an explanation &#8211; &#8220;Public pressure has been the driving force of pollution policy in China.&#8221; Yet CNN overlooked the most crucial factor, which is, how did China make enormous strides in tackling pollution?</p>
<p>CNN quoted a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America on Monday as saying &#8220;significant declines&#8221; in PM2.5 levels across China have been realized from 2013 to 2017. But not surprisingly, it would not let go of any opportunity to play up China&#8217;s challenge. This time, it noted, &#8220;The government is facing an uneasy balancing act: it must handle the public&#8217;s environmental concerns but avoid taking action that would slow growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN said so as if only the Chinese government is facing the test. The truth is, which government is not? The most crucial part in China&#8217;s progress in cutting pollution, which CNN will not recognize, is the power of Chinese system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping warned in 2013 that officials will be held responsible for life if projects they approved are found to harm the environment. In 2015, China established the mechanism of environmental inspection. As of December 2017, over 18,000 government officials were penalized for their failure to control pollution after inspection, and 234 Party and government leaders have been punished in 2019&#8217;s environmental inspection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese officials are put on guard to take environmental protection seriously, and some are even fired for failing to fix pollution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only a part of a string of China&#8217;s environmental policies. But because these policies can be well implemented, even some Western media admit that China is winning in the war against pollution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, China has seen swift PM2.5 reduction. A growing scale of deserted lands has become natural oxygen bars. Wetlands have been significantly increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which other country has the capability to improve its environment at this spectacular speed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As India is suffering from &#8220;unbearable levels&#8221; of air pollution, an increasing number of Indian netizens and media have been asking why India can&#8217;t learn from China and reach the same achievements as China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>India has been plagued by air pollution for a long time. Agricultural burn-off and vehicle exhaust are the major reasons. But given different constituencies in rural and urban areas in the country, urban politicians find it difficult to convince farmers not to burn straw that much, while rural politicians can barely persuade residents in the city not to drive their cars that often. Policymakers are pretty constrained in what they can do.</p>
<p>But in China, as Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington, once said, &#8220;If they want something to be done, they can do it. Nothing stands between the decision and the implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consciously or unconsciously, CNN ignored that the Chinese government has long before noticed the concerns of its people. The key is not about public pressure, but about how exactly to respond to it. This is the biggest stumbling block for the West to understand China &#8211; while it focuses on the Chinese government&#8217;s challenges, it turns a blind eye to how China resolves the task, which happens to be one of the most crucial issues in a country&#8217;s governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Residents receive free health checkup at a health center in Hotan, Northwest China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, August 23, 2019. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>&#8220;The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.&#8221; These words were adopted in the Constitution of the World Health Organization in 1946, establishing the right to health as a fundamental human right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As China has once again become the target of criticism over the alleged human rights abuses in its Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, let&#8217;s examine how the region&#8217;s medical services have developed and the status of the people&#8217;s health conditions there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang&#8217;s medical services used to be in a poor state that saw a shortage of doctors and medicine. The region suffered epidemics of the plague, smallpox and cholera. It has witnessed a significant improvement over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Official statistics show there were 15,721 medical institutions of various kinds by the end of 2016 and the average life expectancy there has risen to over 72 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A multi-layered basic social security system with wide coverage has been in place and special attention is given to the poor. Just last month, the Xinjiang regional government announced that it has appropriated about 2.5 billion yuan ($350 million) this year for medical assistance for its poor population.</p>
<p>This is big progress. As the country makes strides to improve health and development, Xinjiang is no exception. China&#8217;s achievements have been acclaimed by many international heavyweights, including Bill Gates. The billionaire philanthropist said in a recent interview with the Xinhua News Agency that China&#8217;s remarkable progress in improving health equity and reducing poverty could offer lessons for other developing countries to accelerate their development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has been endeavoring to improve human rights, notably in ensuring fundamental rights and development rights over the past 70 years. Xinjiang&#8217;s progress in health and medical services is the epitome of China&#8217;s improvement in the sector over the past decades. The country is doing what it can to promote healthcare reform and improve health equity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philip Alston, the UN&#8217;s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, observed in a report in 2017 that the &#8220;health gap&#8221; between the US and its peer countries continued to grow and that Americans could expect to live shorter and sicker lives. How can Washington sit on the moral high ground and criticize China&#8217;s Xinjiang governance and human rights development?&nbsp;</p>
<p>West and China have different judgment criteria when it comes to human rights. But there should be no dispute that Xinjiang, a region facing terrorism and extremism threats, should prioritize the protection of fundamental human rights, including the right to live, health and development. What China is doing in its Xinjiang region is ensuring stability so that the people&#8217;s fundamental rights can be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the country&#8217;s and region&#8217;s efforts, Xinjiang is embracing its best time in history with improved livelihood, social stability, security and economic development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to improve human rights there is to continue the current governance, and not be influenced by Western criticisms that are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
