<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Greeks, Albanians and other migrants gathered in front of the City Hall and lit up candles in memory of the dead in an event organized by the Federation of Albanian Communities in Greece with the support of the Municipality of Athens.</p>
<p>The event, which aimed to send a strong message of friendship and solidarity with Albanian people in these difficult times, was also supported by the Greek forum of migrants comprised of communities of migrants from dozens of countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We remember the 51 people who lost their lives during the quake in our country and we are in pain. We want to do anything possible to help people who have lost their loved ones, especially for children who are in a serious psychological condition,&#8221; Anna Paschali, a 50-year-old Albanian migrant who has been living in Greece for the past 25 years, told Xinhua.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Paschali is a member of an organization mobilized to assist quake-devastated Albanians. They have collected clothing items, medicine and cash to be sent to the neighboring country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing whatever we can. I would like to voice our gratitude to the City of Athens which helped us organize this event,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Governments at various levels in Greece are offering help, while labor unions, medical associations, NGOs, soccer clubs and ordinary citizens are collecting humanitarian aid to be sent to Albania.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a community here we are deeply touched by the assistance Greek people and the Greek government have provided from the first hours,&#8221; said Ermal Soulai, president of the Federation, referring to the Greek teams of experts dispatched to help rescue people from the debris.</p>

<p>Representing Albanian students in Greece, Skerdilaidi Agaliu, member of the Board of Directors in the Federation, visited Durres while search and rescue operations were still underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;The image of the town was tragic. It resembled a bombarded site. Without exaggeration a large part of the town has vanished,&#8221; he told Xinhua.</p>
<p>&#8220;(In) these difficult days, Europe and the country where we&#8217;ve been living in the past 30 years have shown that we are not alone,&#8221; Agaliu said.</p>
<p>Quake prone Greece has been hit numerous times by deadly tremors and Greek people know the pain of losing relatives, friends, neighbors and properties within brief moments.</p>
<p>Albanians represent the largest immigrant population in Greece, according to the 2011 census. Mainly since the 1990s, hundreds of thousands have been seeking a better life in Greece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Russian Navy will receive more than 480 units of military equipment and armament this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with top defense industry managers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The list includes two submarines, 23 surface ships and support vessels, three aircraft, four coastal missile systems and more than 400 units of various missile and torpedo weapons,&#8221; Putin said.</p>
<p>He added that Russian naval strategic nuclear forces are being re-equipped with modern Borei-class submarines with Bulava ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>According to Putin, the upgraded Borei-A-class submarine Prince Vladimir is undergoing final tests, with four more under construction.</p>
<p>Ships equipped with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles form the basis of the Navy&#8217;s strategic non-nuclear forces, Putin said.</p>
<p>These missiles are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 1,500 kilometers, he said, adding Russia plans to more than double the number of these missiles by 2023.</p>
<p>Putin said that the pace of equipping the fleet with maritime zone ships is accelerating, with the construction of nine surface ships of this class currently underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, we will continue to develop the Navy, making it modern, ocean-going and highly efficient,&#8221; Putin added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spain&#8217;s new parliament met for its opening session Tuesday, with the far-right Vox as the third-largest party following a divisive election that failed to resolve years of deadlock.</p>
<p>Just over three weeks ­after the vote, lawmakers were on Tuesday taking the oath of ­office, although there was little indication of when a government would be formed.</p>
<p>The legislature has been gridlocked since an inconclusive April election which the Socialists won but without a majority &#8211; in an outcome repeated on November 10, leaving Pedro Sanchez a winner but weakened. This time, Vox more than doubled its showing, snaring 52 of the parliament&#8217;s 350 seats.</p>
<p>Just days after the election, Sanchez and the radical left-wing Podemos agreed in principle to form a coalition government in what would be the first such power-sharing deal in the country&#8217;s modern history.</p>
<p>Such a government would only have 155 seats, leaving it dependent on support from other factions to pass an investiture vote for which it would need a minimum of 176.</p>
<p>Sanchez&#8217;s negotiating team began talks with the Republican Left of Catalonia, a Catalan separatist party which won 13 seats in November&#8217;s election but has so far refused to offer its backing. In exchange for support, the party wants talks on the Catalan crisis, which would likely touch on its demand for a referendum on self-determination, an issue completely ruled out by Madrid.</p>

<p>Russia must further develop its modern and high-tech navy and keep equipping it with latest generation weapons, President Vladimir Putin said Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the coming years, it is necessary to actively increase the combat capabilities of the navy,&#8221; he said in opening remarks before an annual series of meetings with defense officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many respects, this depends on the planned commissioning of frigates and submarines modified for the use of Zircon hypersonic missiles, which has become extremely important for maintaining strategic stability, as well as destroyers and universal landing ships,&#8221; Putin said.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Russia must ensure that promising military research and development works stimulate the production of demanded civilian products, so that defense enterprises and shipyards expand its range and production volumes, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Putin told the parliament that the advanced Zircon missile could have a speed of Mach 9 (over 11,000 kph) and a flight range of more than 1,000 kilometers.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">This image grabbed from a video shows delegates posing for a group photo while attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, Spain, Dec. 2, 2019. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 officially opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. (Xinhua)</p>
<p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement amid unclear prospects and challenges to multilateralism.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began with a warning from Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): &#8220;If we continue as we are doing, we run the risk of increasing the temperature of the planet and that will have an effect and terrible consequences for humanity and threaten our existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not doing enough and we are not even getting close to what we need to do to control this situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the world would need &#8220;solidarity and flexibility to win the war against climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guterres explained that there is only one way to control the temperature of the planet and that was &#8220;limited use of fossil fuels. If we don&#8217;t do that we will end up in a catastrophic situation,&#8221; he warned, before praising the work of young climate activists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young people are telling the leaders that they need to fight against the climate emergency,&#8221; commented the UN chief.</p>
<p>The conference is hosted by the Spanish capital after Chile, which presides over the event, had to step down as host due to social unrest.</p>
<p>Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez welcomed delegates to Spain, saying &#8220;Madrid will be the world capital of the fight against the climate emergency &#8230; But above all we want to be the capital of dialogue between nations united against a common enemy for all humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that although the event was being held in Spain, it is being presided over by Chile. &#8220;This is Chile&#8217;s COP: it is Chile that has organized the leadership and that has worked for an alliance against climate change and the success of this event will belong to Chile.&#8221;</p>
<p>TIME FOR ACTION</p>
<p>The major task for the delegates is to discuss Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the measures to promote voluntary international cooperation by paying a price on carbon, emission trading schemes and other market mechanisms.</p>
<p>The conference comes as global efforts to mitigate climate change are on the brink of failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global contributions to climate change fall far short,&#8221; said Berthold Kuhn, an expert on sustainable development with the Free University of Berlin and senior advisor to the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute.</p>
<p>According to a UN Environment Programme report on the emissions gap published last week, countries have collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.</p>
<p>The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5 percent per year in the last decade. In 2018, emissions totaled 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than the 1.5 degree goal set in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This critical situation has prompted the conference, which will last till Dec. 13, to choose &#8220;Time for Action&#8221; as its motto.</p>
<p>Kuhn believes that market mechanisms should be well designed to stimulate investment in projects like reforestation and other climate-friendly economic activities. Therefore, COP25 is of great importance to implement the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>COOPERATION CRUCIAL</p>
<p>The event comes after the United States formally initiated its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement earlier last month, impacting global cooperation on climate change with its unilateral move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be more difficult for the world to stop climate change by reducing the annual emissions effectively to zero without the United States,&#8221; said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>
<p>World leaders and experts are using COP25 as a venue for promoting multilateralism. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, joined the event on Monday, saying that &#8220;if we work together, we will go faster and we will be as ambitious as possible in the COP negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China&#8217;s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told reporters on Sunday that China will try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,&#8221; said Lu, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Britain&#8217;s Boris Johnson said Sunday he had ordered the security services to step up monitoring of convicted terrorists released early from prison, prompting accusations that he was exploiting the London Bridge attack for political gain less than two weeks before elections.</p>
<p>The prime minister revealed officials were scrutinizing around 74 people with terrorist convictions who had been released early from prison like Usman Khan, who left jail in December last year and went on to stab two people to death in Friday&#8217;s rampage.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are being properly invigilated to make sure there is no threat,&#8221; Johnson told the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken a lot of action as you can imagine in the last 48 hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson and the head of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attended a vigil on Monday for the two victims.</p>
<p>The vigil was held in Guildhall Yard, in the heart of the City of London, to honor Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, as well as the injured, the emergency services and members of the public who tackled the attacker.</p>
<p>Khan, 28, was shot dead wearing a fake explosives vest by police on London Bridge after a stabbing spree launched in a nearby hall hosting an ex-offenders&#8217; event that also left three people injured.</p>
<p>Johnson blamed the previous ­Labour government for changing the law in 2008 to allow for the early release of prisoners and vowed to introduce minimum 14-year sentences if he regains power in the December 12 vote.</p>
<p>He penned an article setting out the new stance in The Mail on Sunday newspaper, under the headline &#8220;Give me a majority and I&#8217;ll keep you safe from terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>Critics hit out at him for appearing to politicize Friday&#8217;s attack &#8211; including the family of victim Jack Merritt, who said he died &#8220;doing what he loved.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Johnson has vowed to stiffen sentences following the attack, Merritt&#8217;s family said their son &#8220;believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge&#8221; and that &#8220;he always took the side of the underdog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary,&#8221; they said in a statement.</p>

<p>Their EC145 helicopter lost radio and radar contact while on a rescue and reconnaissance flight in the Var region Sunday night.</p>
<p>The three were found dead at 1:30 am near the town of Rove, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner and his secretary of state Laurent Nunez said in a statement.</p>
<p>An investigation was under way to determine the circumstances of the crash.</p>
<p>&#8220;While France is preparing today to pay tribute to 13 of its soldiers who died serving it [in Mali], our country is losing three everyday heroes who gave their lives to protect the French,&#8221; Castaner and Nunez said.</p>
<p>Two people were killed on Sunday by the floods in the French Riviera, which has been hit by fresh torrential rains a week after extreme weather left six dead.</p>
<p>In the Var region, a shepherd was swept away as he was trying to cross a ford in his 4&#215;4 while tending to his flock. His body was found in his vehicle late Sunday night 300 meters downstream from where he was last seen, the prefecture said early Monday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the region, the owner of a stable was found dead two hours after he was also washed away while out watching over his animals, it said.</p>
<p>The Var and the neighboring Alpes-Maritimes region were on red alert for floods which disrupted train services and cut the A8 motorway for four hours Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Many cultural and sporting events were also called off due to the bad weather, including Paris Saint-Germain&#8217;s Ligue 1 match at Monaco.</p>
<p>During the previous weekend, heavy rains caused the deaths of six people in the Var.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday he would strengthen prison sentences, vowing to boost security after an attack in the British capital by a man convicted of terrorism who was released early from prison.</p>
<p>With less than two weeks before Britain heads to the polls, law and order has raced to the top of the election agenda ­after Usman Khan, wearing a fake suicide vest and wielding knives, killed two people on Friday before being shot dead by police.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s Conservatives have long championed tough police and prison measures, but opposition parties have criticized the governing party for overseeing almost a decade of cuts to public services.</p>
<p>Trying to distance himself from those cuts, Johnson said if he won the December 12 election he would invest more money in the prison system and make sentences tougher.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to bring in tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders and for terrorists,&#8221; he told the BBC&#8217;s<br />
<em> Andrew Marr Show</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I absolutely deplore the fact that this man was out on the street, I think it was absolutely repulsive and we are going to take action.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was keen to portray his rival for prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as being weak on crime, blaming the opposition party for bringing in a law that automatically released some prisoners early when it was in government.</p>
<p>Corbyn, a veteran peace campaigner, said he believed convicted terrorists should &#8220;not necessarily&#8221; serve their full prison terms, suggesting it would depend on the nature of their sentence and also how they had behaved in prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on the circumstances, it depends on the ­sentence, but crucially it depends on what they&#8217;ve done in the prison,&#8221; Corbyn told Sky News.</p>
<p>Despite criticizing cases where police and the army were accused of operating a shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland, the Labour leader said the police had no choice but to shoot the attacker dead.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s attack on Friday on London Bridge stirred memories of Britain&#8217;s last election in 2017, when three militants drove a van into pedestrians in the same part of the capital and attacked people, killing eight and injuring at least 48.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s rampage was brought to an end, in part, because of bystanders, who wrestled him to the ground before the police shot him dead. So far the police have found no evidence to suggest Khan was working with others.</p>
<p>Three people remain in hospital, two of them in a stable condition, after Friday&#8217;s attack. The third person is suffering from less serious injuries.</p>

<p>Malta&#8217;s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat will step down on January 18, party sources told AFP on Saturday, following mounting criticism of his response to the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.</p>
<p>The announcement came as the main suspect in the 2017 car bomb killing, tycoon Yorgen Fenech, 38, was charged with complicity in the murder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court also ordered Fenech&#8217;s assets to be frozen and he was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Party insiders said Muscat would step down once those behind the killing had been charged and his Labour Party had chosen a new leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;He always said that he will be leaving soon and he feels that now is the time to go,&#8221; said one party source.</p>
<p>First, however, he wanted to see that the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder was solved ­under his watch, as he had promised, sources added.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the mastermind or masterminds are arraigned in court, he plans to announce that he will be stepping down and that there will be a leadership election on January 18,&#8221; a party source told AFP.</p>
<p>The sources did not say when 45-year-old Muscat would announce his decision &#8211; or whether it would be via a televised announcement &#8211; but they stressed that he would not stay beyond January 18.</p>
<p>The news came amid mounting pressure from Caruana Galizia&#8217;s family and protesters on the streets, who have cried foul over his handling of the affair.</p>
<p>The escalating murder investigation has rocked the tiny Mediterranean island and reached the highest rungs of politics, with two ministers and Muscat&#8217;s chief of staff Keith Schembri stepping down from their posts this week.</p>
<p>Fenech has identified Schembri as the mastermind behind Caruana Galizia&#8217;s killing, according to sources.</p>
<p>Schembri was arrested on Tuesday, but his release on Thursday sparked accusations of a coverup.</p>
<p>Muscat, who has vowed to resign if links were found between himself and the murder, said Friday he would remain in power, telling reporters he wanted &#8220;this case to be closed under my watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caruana Galizia, a popular journalist and blogger described as a &#8220;one-woman WikiLeaks,&#8221; exposed cronyism and sleaze within the country&#8217;s political and business elite.</p>

<p>Paris, London and Berlin on Saturday welcomed six new European countries to the INSTEX barter mechanism, which is designed to circumvent US sanctions against trade with Iran by avoiding use of the dollar.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo taken on June 26, 2019 shows the United Nations Security Council&#8217;s semi-annual briefing on the implementation of Resolution 2231, which endorsed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program, at the UN headquarters in New York. Joao Vale de Almeida, head of the EU delegation to the United Nations, on Wednesday reiterated support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, despite mounting tensions between the United States and the Islamic republic. (Photo: Xinhua)</p>
<p>&#8220;As founding shareholders of the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges [INSTEX], France, Germany and the United Kingdom warmly welcome the decision taken by the governments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, to join INSTEX as shareholders,&#8221; the three said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The Paris-based INSTEX functions as a clearing house allowing Iran to continue to sell oil and import other products or services in exchange.</p>
<p>The system has not yet enabled any transactions.</p>
<p>Washington in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from the international agreement governing Iran&#8217;s nuclear program and reinstated heavy sanctions against Tehran.</p>
<p>The accession of the six new members &#8220;further strengthens INSTEX and demonstrates European efforts to facilitate legitimate trade between Europe and Iran,&#8221; France, Germany and Britain said.</p>
<p>It represents &#8220;a clear expression of our continuing commitment to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action&#8221; &#8211; the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal &#8211; the trio added.</p>
<p>They insisted Iran must return to full compliance with its commitments under the deal &#8220;without delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We remain fully committed to pursuing our efforts towards a diplomatic resolution within the framework of the JCPoA.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2015 deal set out the terms under which Iran would restrict its nuclear program to civilian use in exchange for the lifting of Western sanctions.</p>
<p>Since the US pullout, Iran has taken four steps back from the accord.</p>
<p>The latest was on November 4 when its engineers began feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into mothballed enrichment centrifuges at the underground Fordow plant south of Tehran.</p>
