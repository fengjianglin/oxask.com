<p>Cantonese crosstalk, a branch of the Chinese traditional comedic performance in the form of a dialogue, was offered 2.6 million yuan ($369,801) as initial funding for a foundation to stop the art form from disappearing.</p>
<p>Cantonese crosstalk developed from the crosstalk of northern China that was based on Putonghua in the 1950s. After nearly 70 years of development, &#8220;Cantonese crosstalk is an indispensable folk art in the Guangfu region, a Cantonese-speaking region containing Guangzhou, capital of South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao,&#8221; according to a document sent to the Global Times by the Chinese Cultural Promotion Society of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Based on the traditional art forms of speaking, learning and teasing as well as singing in northern China&#8217;s crosstalk, Cantonese crosstalk integrates the cultural elements of the Guangfu region and the characteristics of the Cantonese language. The contents of the performance are more in line with the interests and tastes of people living in the region.</p>
<p>As more art forms and different languages are introduced in the region, Cantonese crosstalk has become less popular and less well-known among the younger generations, and there is even a risk of it disappearing. &#8220;Cantonese crosstalk has entered the stage of talent shortage and lack of creation,&#8221; Wu Xiaoxi, chief executive officer of the promotion society, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>There are less than 20 Cantonese crosstalk performers in Guangdong Province now, according to a report by China News Service.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, a special fund was launched on Saturday in Guangzhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wu said that the fund will be used to seek and train new talent. &#8220;We will go to kindergartens and schools to carry out the language art training of Cantonese among the young generations, and we will hold crosstalk contests in Cantonese regularly,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As well as these measures, there are plans to edit and print textbooks about crosstalk, which will also need funding.</p>
<p>The initial fund of 2.6 million yuan has already been prepared and the promotion society has received donations from many crosstalk fans. The use of the funding will be managed and supervised by the promotion society.</p>
<p>The fund is one of various measures to protect and develop the folk art. An educational team for Cantonese crosstalk is being established, organized by professional performers who want to popularize the traditional artform.</p>

<p>Lions, giraffe, zebras, monkeys… a new exhibition featuring the artwork of Chinese artist Shen Shubin has turned the Beijiao Cultural Center in Foshan, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, into a painted zoo with his animal-themed works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Creative Evolution exhibition features dozens of his paintings from this year including<br />
<em>The Rational Meaning of Beijing</em> series and<br />
<em>Orientation</em> series as well as some of his classic works like the<br />
<em>Embrace</em> series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shen began creating animal-inspired art years ago. According to the artist, he has been an animal lover since childhood, a time when he liked to play with cats, dogs and even rabbits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early<br />
<em>Embrace</em> series, you will see animals embrace each other even though some of them are enemies,&#8221; the artist said at a talk prior to the opening of the exhibition on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can see a clear message of understanding, reconciliation and peace.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Shen does is to find a balance between reality and ideals. The ruins appearing in his paintings from time to time show his thoughts on today&#8217;s society and the reconstruction of human society,&#8221; exhibition curator Gao Yuan told media at the opening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to portray these animals, Shen often spends a lot of time researching them and watching them in videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, even more important is the feelings behind these creatures, which delivers a certain message to viewers,&#8221; the artist said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exhibition is set to run until December 10 before touring to the artist&#8217;s hometown in North China&#8217;s Shanxi Province.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Minister of Antiquities of Egypt Khaled Elanani Photo: Li Hao/GT</p>
<p>On Thursday, Minister of Antiquities of Egypt Khaled Elanani attended a media event at the Embassy of Egypt in Beijing to deliver a lecture on new archaeological discoveries and express his country&#8217;s willingness to enhance cultural cooperation with China in the future.</p>
<p>Elanani presented new archaeological finds including the recent significant discovery of two young lion corpses unearthed alongside a group of mummified animals. Previously a tour guide, Elanani said he hopes to attract more Chinese tourists to Egypt by promoting Egyptian civilization and heritage. New museums are being constructed and renovated to improve the effectiveness of displays. Additionally, more tourist sites have also been opened, including the Tomb of Mehu in Saqqara and the Opet Temple at Karnak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that as two great civilizations, Egypt and China have many cultural similarities, not least of which are that the two bear the heavy burden of working to retrieve looted relics. Both countries have made immense efforts to repatriate lost artifacts. Since the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, more than 150,000 artifacts have been returned to the nation. This also marks the closeness between the two nations, as in 2017 Egypt returned smuggled paper currency and vouchers dating back to the early 20th century to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to Eygpt, Elanani noted that 1,163 relics and 21,660 ancient coins have been repatriated to the country over the last three years. He expressed his hope that the two countries could work together to return lost relics to their home countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elanani said he was amazed by China&#8217;s heritage-preservation efforts and admires the fact that there are more than 5,000 museums in China and that the National Museum of China alone attracts about 8 million visitors every year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are competing with each other,&#8221; Elanani said, noting that it seems that new, big discoveries are made in China almost every week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very happy that each day we know more about our civilizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calling them &#8220;Indiana Jones,&#8221; Elanani stressed that the results of archaeological projects come from scholars and researchers who work meticulously at heritage sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Field researchers come from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, Egypt has embarked on 340 cooperative missions with 25 countries. A Chinese team joined one such project in November 2018. Elanani said he looks forward to seeing more Chinese research centers and universities work in this field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luo Lin, a professor of Arabic language and culture studies, told the Global Times that Egyptian relics are well known to Chinese people and that many museums in China would love to hold exhibitions for their display. He added that he hopes more precious relics can be put on display for lovers of history in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elanani noted that negotiations are underway with the National Museum of China for a temporary exhibition. During his visit to China, he has also met with the president of Peking University to work on exchange projects in academic and research fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new project evaluates cultural relics based on blockchain and big data technologies. It will help track down the origins of certain relics at exchange exhibitions and work to return looted relics.</p>
<p>According to Tan Ping, director of the China Cultural Relics Exchange Center, evaluation plays a key role in national-level exhibitions and other areas. The new project will further develop this system and build a platform to improve cultural exchanges.</p>

<p>The New York Botanical Garden is rolling into a holiday season with its annual holiday train show, which features architectural replicas of the city&#8217;s Central Park &#8211; one of the most popular urban parks in the US.</p>
<p>Now in its 28th edition, the annual event transports visitors to a miniature metropolis as model trains zip through an enchanting display of more than 175 landmarks in New York, each re-created using items such as bark, lotus pods, acorns, cinnamon sticks and other natural materials.</p>
<p>Six replicas made their debut this year, which are Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Terrace, the Dairy, the Naumburg Bandshell and two graceful pedestrian bridges, according to Victoria Lewis, the botanical garden&#8217;s manager of interpretive content.</p>
<p>&#8220;In real life Bow Bridge is made of steel, but for our version, it&#8217;s twigs and willow bark,&#8221; said Lewis. Dating from 1862, the Bow Bridge is known for its subtle shape which is reminiscent of the bow of an archer or violinist.</p>
<p>The new miniature replicas are arrayed in a tableau with existing Central Park collection, including the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater and the Old Bandstand. In addition, famous New York buildings that are either next to the park or just inside it are on display, including the Plaza Hotel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which is part of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s holiday train show is different from the ones in the previous years as it is held in a temporary exhibition space tailored just for the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show used to be held in the conservatory, the palm dome of which is under restoration.</p>
<p>Lewis said because the temperature is lower in the exhibition space this year compared to that of the conservatory, visitors will see more evergreen plants instead of tropical plants at the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has the effect of being more wintry and it really creates this wonderful indoor winter wonderland,&#8221; said Lewis.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 25 G-scale model trains and trolleys hum along a nearly half-a-mile-long track past re-creations of iconic sites from all five boroughs of New York City, the Hudson River Valley, and other locations in New York State.</p>
<p>The holiday train show has already started and will be running through January 26, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robbers made off with priceless 18th century jewelry from a state museum in Dresden on Monday, police and museum directors said, in a major art heist that has shocked Germany.</p>
<p>The thieves at dawn broke into the Green Vault at Dresden&#8217;s Royal Palace &#8211; home to around 4,000 precious objects of ivory, gold, silver and jewels &#8211; after a power cut deactivated the alarm.</p>
<p>The stolen artifacts included brilliant-cut diamonds that once belonged to a collection of jewelry of 18th-century Saxony ruler Augustus the Strong.</p>
<p>Museum directors had earlier feared much of three sets of diamond jewelry in the collection were snatched, but the loss turned out to be more limited than thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;The criminals didn&#8217;t manage to take everything,&#8221; director of Dresden&#8217;s state art collections Marion Ackermann told public broadcaster ZDF on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the stolen items are &#8220;of inestimable art-historical and cultural-historical value,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot put an exact value on them because they are priceless,&#8221; said Ackermann, adding she was &#8220;shocked by the brutality of the break-in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thieves launched their brazen raid after having set off a fire at an electrical panel near the museum in the early hours of Monday, deactivating its alarm as well as street lighting, police said.</p>
<p>Despite the power cut, a surveillance camera kept working and filmed two men breaking in.</p>
<p>A video released by police showed one of the men, armed with a flashlight, using an axe to smash the display case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole act lasted only a few minutes,&#8221; said police in a statement.</p>
<p>The suspects then fled in an Audi A6 and remain on the run.</p>
<p>The apparent getaway car was found on fire later elsewhere in the city, said police, adding that the vehicle was being examined for clues.</p>
<p>Bild daily said the heist was &#8220;probably the biggest art theft since World War II.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk Syndram, director of the Green Vault itself, said the targeted jewelry sets amounted to &#8220;a kind of world heritage,&#8221; totalling about 100 items.</p>
<p>Founded by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723, the Green Vault is one of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the oldest museums in Europe, the Green Vault holds treasures including a 63.8-centimeter figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia.</p>
<p>The museum is now made up of two sections &#8211; a historical part and a new area.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s break-in targeted the historical section, which contains around three-quarters of the museum&#8217;s treasures and which has a strict limit on the number of daily visitors.</p>
<p>Exhibits are arranged in nine rooms, including an ivory room, a silver gilt room and the central &#8220;Hall of Treasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of its most valuable pieces, the green diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is a headline attraction in the temporary exhibition<br />
<em>Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
