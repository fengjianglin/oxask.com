<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Inset: Zoo staff examine 2-month old Bei Bei Photo: IC</p>
<p>He was born in Washington DC and took his first steps in the US capital, but at age 4, it&#8217;s time to head &#8220;home&#8221; &#8211; to China.</p>
<p>Bei Bei, the last young panda living at the National Zoo, will leave Washington on Tuesday aboard a specially outfitted FedEx plane, as planned even before he took his first breath.</p>
<p>Such are the strict rules of &#8220;panda diplomacy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tearful goodbye</strong></p>
<p>In front of the zoo&#8217;s panda enclosure on a chilly day, schoolchildren in winter coats and hats line up to say farewell, many of them with signs reading &#8220;Bye bye Bei Bei.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Zoo &#8211; a branch of the venerable Smithsonian, the world&#8217;s largest museum and research complex &#8211; has organized a week of events to celebrate the departure of Bei Bei, which means &#8220;precious, treasure&#8221; in Chinese.</p>
<p>Kids can write postcards for the panda, which will go with him to China, watch zookeepers offer him special treats, attend Q&amp;A sessions with zoo personnel or just watch him play.</p>
<p>Through it all, Bei Bei&#8230; munches on bamboo.</p>
<p>Marty Dearie is one of Bei Bei&#8217;s keepers. He saw the male cub born in August 2015 on the &#8220;panda cam&#8221; &#8211; which is trained on the zoo&#8217;s pandas around the clock. Bei Bei, who now weighs a healthy 114 kilograms, lives with his parents, dad Tian Tian and mom Mei Xiang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our job has been to get him prepared for the trip to China from the moment he was born,&#8221; Dearie told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that was coming &#8211; it&#8217;s part of the loan agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s &#8220;panda diplomacy&#8221; has evolved over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point in time, Beijing gave pandas to friendly nations, but now that the animals are considered &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, China lends pandas to zoos around the world.</p>
<p>Once a panda reaches the age of 4, he or she is repatriated to breed with other animals at sanctuaries in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bei Bei&#8217;s siblings, brother Tai Shan and sister Bao Bao, have already been returned to China.</p>
<p>Tian Tian and Mei Xiang will remain at the National Zoo until at least December 2020, when a new deal would need to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Even though the conditions were always set in stone, Dearie is still heartbroken to see Bei Bei go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a very emotional person, I can admit to that,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure on the day of the move for Bei Bei, I&#8217;ll be in some tears.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Honey and sugarcane</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving a giant panda to another continent is no easy task.</p>
<p>For several weeks, Bei Bei&#8217;s keepers have been training him to sit in the crate in which he will travel to China on the nonstop 16-hour flight from Washington to Chengdu.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, we were able to close both doors and he sits in there comfortably,&#8221; says Dearie.</p>
<p>A keeper and a veterinarian will make the trip with Bei Bei. The National Zoo staff will prepare a special stash of treats for him &#8211; like most giant pandas, he eats constantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably be taking 15 or 20 kilos of bamboo with him at least. He&#8217;ll also get apples, sweet potatoes, carrots. We&#8217;ll probably take some sugarcane. There might be honey, biscuits,&#8221; Dearie explains.</p>
<p>FedEx is paying for the flight and the special outfitting of the Boeing 777 &#8211; called the &#8220;Panda Express&#8221; for the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bei Bei and his &#8216;luggage&#8217; will be the only shipment on the aircraft,&#8221; said FedEx spokeswoman Rae Lyn Rushing.</p>
<p>Both the public and his keepers have been enthralled with Bei Bei from the get-go: from his first steps, to an operation in 2016 to remove a lemon-sized chewed-up mass of bamboo from his intestines, to his departure.</p>
<p>The giant panda&#8217;s name was revealed at a naming ceremony in 2015 presided over by then US first lady Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan, the wife of current Chinese President Xi Jinping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such baptisms are now a ritual at other zoos around the world &#8211; France&#8217;s first lady Brigitte Macron attended a similar ceremony with Chinese officials at the Beauval zoo when cub Yuan Meng was named.</p>
<p>Beyond being universally adored, pandas have become an &#8220;extremely successful&#8221; policy tool for China, according to Liselotte Odgaard, a visiting senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank who specializes in US-China-Europe relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a symbol of China&#8217;s history, its benevolence, its generosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s also a lucrative policy tool &#8211; zoos pay China millions of dollars a year for their pandas, which bring in hordes of visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a regular &#8220;panda business,&#8221; Odgaard says.</p>

<p>Mackova Victoria from Slovakia performed<br />
<em>wuqinxi</em>, an ancient Chinese physical exercise mimicking the movements of five animals.</p>
<p>This time, the 17-year-old girl was on the stage of the 12th &#8220;Chinese Bridge&#8221; language proficiency contest for non-Chinese secondary students, which concluded Friday in Zhengzhou, capital of Central China&#8217;s Henan Province.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 2,000-year-old exercise is cool but few people have heard of it,&#8221; Victoria said.</p>
<p>In addition to the<br />
<em> wuqinxi</em>, Victoria was also fascinated by Chinese milk tea. &#8220;Perhaps I can open a milk tea shop in Bratislava,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is among more than 120 students from 105 countries who competed in the contest which started on October 21.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more foreigners have started learning Chinese. Since 2002, the Beijing-based Confucius Institute Headquarters has organized a series of &#8220;Chinese Bridge&#8221; language competitions, attracting more than 1.4 million teenagers worldwide.</p>
<p>More than 530 Confucius institutes and 1,100 Confucius classrooms have so far been established in 158 countries and regions to introduce Chinese language and culture, according to the headquarters.</p>
<p>Germole Iacopo from Italy was awarded champion of Friday&#8217;s final contest after three rounds of fierce competition. He has studied Chinese for four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;This competition gave me a chance to communicate with young people all around the world. We should learn to appreciate each other&#8217;s differences,&#8221; Germole said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sidy Diallo has traveled the globe, sometimes running marathons in consecutive weeks to preach the still largely unappreciated benefits of running barefoot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man without shoes. Watch out for him!&#8221; a pedicab driver shakes his head in amazement at the sight of the tall, spindly runner making his way through Central Park.</p>
<p>Having trained for and run 63 marathons barefoot since 2015, Diallo has grown accustomed to the full gamut of reactions, from sympathy to open hostility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insane! He&#8217;s crazy!&#8221; shouted one spectator he passed while running the Chicago Marathon three weeks ago, said the Guinean-born Diallo.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people see me like that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it brings out the animal in them and some get angry&#8230; and even aggressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others wince, worried he is in pain or doing damage to his feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the fear on the faces of some people,&#8221; Diallo says.</p>
<p>There was definitely pain in the early days, he acknowledges. A physician by training who switched careers and is now a French diplomat, he made his first shoeless runs a bit tentatively.</p>
<p>Having taken up running relatively late in life, at 55, he had run 100 marathons &#8211; wearing shoes &#8211; starting in 2010. But by the time he turned 60 in 2015, he was craving a new challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A price to pay, at first</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There is a price to pay&#8221; in the first painful days of barefoot running, Diallo concedes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your feet and legs have to adapt. Your entire body has to get used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like others before him, Diallo, who posts on Facebook as Dr Barefoot, has reverted to the stride used by the first humans, for whom running barefoot was a matter of survival, not just fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2009 book<br />
<em>Born to Run</em> by Chris McDougall sparked a mini-revolution in the US running community, inspiring many runners to go minimalist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McDougall wrote about a tribe in northern Mexico known as the Tarahumaras whose members could run dozens of miles a day along rugged canyon paths wearing simple sandals cut out of old car tires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He taught himself to run as they did &#8211; and as ancient man did &#8211; using a style known as a forefoot strike, in which the ball of the foot lands first, rather than the heel strike used by nearly all shoe-wearing runners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you run with shoes, the impact with each stride is 100 percent,&#8221; generally placing great pressure on the heel, Diallo explained. &#8220;When you run barefoot, the body naturally cushions the impact,&#8221; dramatically lessening it.</p>
<p>Several scientific studies have concluded that barefoot running is indeed less traumatizing to the body than the heel-strike running that the cushioned heels of sports shoes encourages.</p>
<p>Diallo and McDougall say barefoot running has helped them avoid major injuries. Ira Rohde, president of the New York chapter of the Barefoot Runners Society, agrees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;You feel good&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>But despite the publicity generated by<br />
<em>Born to Run</em> and the growing popularity of running in the Western world, barefoot running remains a micro-niche.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the USA, the &#8216;fad&#8217; phase of barefoot running is certainly long gone,&#8221; Rohde says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There remains much more interest in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite posting a notice about his plans to run on October 27, Rohde was the only person to show up barefoot, under a light drizzle, for his usual run in Central Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ken Posner, a specialist in barefoot trail-running, says that in 20 years in New York he remembers seeing only seven barefoot runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the 80 marathons or ultra-marathons he has run, he has seen only three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He attributes this to the weight of social convention.</p>
<p>To run without shoes, he says, you have to be &#8220;willing to stand out very visibly from the crowd.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, this author of<br />
<em>Running the Long Path</em> believes his philosophy will spread, as it has among those already running in lightweight, minimally cushioned shoes designed to be just a step away from running barefoot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are starting to do it&#8221; and finding it to be surprisingly enjoyable, Diallo says.&nbsp;</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-10-17/d7751d25-f9ed-4094-b623-114b90c77196.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The skyline at night of the Macao Special Administrative Region, China Photo: IC</p>
<p>The members of the choir who sang the &#8220;Song of the Seven Sons &#8211; Macao&#8221; to mark the Macao&#8217;s return to China reunited to sing the song again at the Ruins of St. Paul&#8217;s in Macao on Tuesday for the 20th anniversary of the event.</p>
<p>The hashtag for the choir&#8217;s reunion has earned almost 100 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo as Chinese netizens shared their warm memories of the song on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a child, it was very popular to copy lyrics, and one of them was the &#8216;Song of the Seven Sons.&#8217; At that time, I felt it was a beautiful song with a lovely melody, but I didn&#8217;t have a deeper understanding of the meaning behind it. Although 20 years have past, I was moved to tears while listening to the song again as the lyrics are so touching,&#8221; Liu Jianran, a 29-year-old civil servant in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Song of the Seven Sons&#8221; is a group of seven patriotic poems written by Wen Yiduo, a prominent Chinese poet and scholar, in 1925. Wen compared the seven ceded or leased areas in China, including the current Macao Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan Province, to seven children who were separated from the motherland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never imagined that the poems could become songs because I thought song lyrics are supposed to have a certain rhyme. But when the song debuted at the Chinese New Year Gala of China Central Television (CCTV) in 1999, I was pleasantly surprised how they perfectly matched the melody and the words of the poem. I remembered the song was played everywhere in Beijing. &#8216;Do you know Macao has never been my real name? I have been away from you for too long, Mother. What they captured is my body, but my soul is always in your keep…'&#8221; said Wen Liming, grandson of Wen Yiduo, in an interview with CCTV 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to thank Mr. Wen for writing these words. They are easy to understand and sing, but also clearly explain the past and present of Macao. It works to enhance the sense of identity and belonging of Macao people to the motherland. In contrast, the general education in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has a big problem, and the rude behaviors of some young people there are really confusing and disappointing,&#8221; a netizen named Cardioid6 wrote on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
