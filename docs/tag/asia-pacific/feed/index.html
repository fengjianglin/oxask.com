<br />The ruling party of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has decided to hold new sessions to &#8220;discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad,&#8221; official media reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers&#8217; Party of Korea (WPK) decided on Tuesday to convene the 5th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK in late December, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>
<p>The 4th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK was held on April 10 this year.</p>
<p>With the year-end deadline set by Pyongyang for diplomacy to produce results, DPRK&#8217;s Vice Foreign Minister Ri Thae Song warned on Tuesday that the U.S. will soon need to decide what kind of &#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> gift&#8221; it will receive from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get,&#8221; Ri said in a statement carried by the KCNA.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Residents help carry a wooden fishing boat into a secured area along the coast in Borongan town, Eastern Samar province, central Philippines, on Monday, as they prepare for Typhoon Kammuri, which churned closer, forcing evacuations and threatening plans for the Southeast Asian Games events near the capital, Manila.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typhoon Kammuri killed at least two people in the Philippines on Tuesday as it tore roofs of houses and forced the international airport in Manila to shut down.</p>
<p>The storm roared ashore late Monday and passed south of Manila &#8211; home to 13 million people &#8211; and thousands of athletes at the regional Southeast Asian Games.</p>
<p>As the typhoon was exiting the Philippines, it hit one last major landmass, the central island of Mindoro, where one man was crushed by a falling tree and another killed by a flying piece of ­lumber, police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of the storm&#8217;s arrival a 33-year-old man was electrocuted on Monday while securing a roof against the winds, which by late Tuesday weakened to a maximum of 140 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>Authorities were still assessing the storm&#8217;s impact, but a small local airport was seriously damaged, many power poles toppled and homes were battered.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of trees fell&#8230; There were a lot of roofs flying during the typhoon too,&#8221; said Junie Castillo, a disaster officer in one of the areas first hit.</p>
<p>Due to the high winds, Manila&#8217;s Ninoy Aquino International Airport was &#8220;closed for operations,&#8221; General Manager Ed Monreal told AFP.</p>
<p>It was not clear when flights would resume, but authorities gave an estimate of 11:00 pm (15:00 GMT) Tuesday and said their decision would depend on the weather.</p>
<p>Nearly 500 flights were canceled, and officials warned passengers not to come to the airport.</p>
<p>One of the terminals AFP visited, which would normally be bustling with morning departures, was occupied by a handful of staff and stranded passengers.</p>
<p>About 340,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in the central ­Bicol region, disaster officials said.</p>
<p>The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, killing hundreds and putting people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s deadliest cyclone on record was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak&nbsp; Photo: AFP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was a &#8220;victim&#8221; of the multimillion dollar 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal that saw state coffers drained on his watch, his lawyer said Tuesday, as the ex-premier gave evidence in his own fraud trial.</p>
<p>Huge sums were stolen from sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, allegedly by the ex-prime minister and his cronies, and spent on everything from high-end real estate to artwork.</p>
<p>Najib&#8217;s coalition was ousted at the polls last year after six decades in power, largely due to public anger over the scandal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has since been arrested and hit with dozens of charges linked to the looting of the investment vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a victim as much as others in the 1MDB scandal,&#8221; his lawyer Muhammad Shafee Adbullah told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leader of the pack is Jho Low,&#8221; he said, referring to fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, a member of ­Najib&#8217;s inner circle who allegedly masterminded the elaborate fraud that spanned from the US to Switzerland, Dubai and Singapore.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crux of my defense is the entire scheme is designed by Jho Low,&#8221; Shafee added.</p>
<p>Najib, 66, went on trial in April over the controversy, in a case centered on the transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.1 million) from former 1MDB unit SRC International into his bank accounts.</p>
<p>Defense proceedings began with Najib giving testimony under oath. He will be cross-examined by prosecutors and is expected to be on the witness stand for around four days.</p>
<p>He began his testimony reading from a 243-page ­statement, recalling his long career in politics and ministerial posts he held since 1978, including the post of finance minister, and giving lengthy background on the setting up of 1MDB and SRC.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers had earlier said it would take two days for him to read the entire statement, but as his testimony went on, it appeared it would take longer. He was able to read only 70 pages in his statement by the end of the day. The trial will resume Wednesday.</p>
<p>Najib is facing four charges of corruption and three counts of money-laundering in the trial. Each charge of corruption carries a maximum jail term of 20 years, and each money-­laundering count is punishable by a term of up to 15 years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Indian government has decided to undertake a massive outreach plan to reach out to the people to educate them about their fundamental duties, confirmed official sources in the Ministry of Law on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The drive is a part of the year-long celebrations to mark the 70th year of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p>According to the official sources, the center government has contacted the ace law body, the Bar Council of India (BCI), to engage law students for making power-point presentations to schools in their areas educating the young students about their fundamental duties as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p>In a bid to reach out to the masses, there is also a plan to identify as many as 70 eminent personalities in every state and their comments regarding citizens&#8217; fundamental duties would be recorded and promoted through various social media platforms.</p>
<p>A similar exercise would be undertaken by the Ministry of External Affairs which would record statements of various personalities of international fame about the citizens&#8217; fundamental duties and promoted on social media.</p>
<p>The focus of the year-long campaign would be on duties of citizens and motivating them towards duties to the nation, said the official sources.</p>

<p>With the recovery of two more bodies from the debris of collapsed houses, the death toll in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu rose to 17 on Monday, officials said.</p>
<p>The houses collapsed Monday morning after heavy rains battered the area, triggering the fall of a 20-feet high compound wall on some smaller houses.</p>
<p>The wall fell on four houses near it and caused them to collapse completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team present on the spot carrying rescue work retrieved two more bodies from the debris and now the death toll stands at 17,&#8221; Uma Maheswari, an official at the disaster management in Coimbatore told Xinhua over the telephone. &#8220;So far we have recovered bodies of three men, 11 women and three children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The houses collapsed at Nadur village near Mettupalayalam in Coimbatore district, about 502 km southwest of Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />According to officials, most of the victims were asleep inside their houses when the compound wall collapsed and buried their houses underneath.</p>
<p>Following the incident, locals raised an alarm and informed the police, who along with disaster response forces and firefighters rushed to the spot.</p>
<p>The collapse of houses triggered panic in the area.</p>
<p>Maheswari said the local government has announced a compensation of 5,571 U.S. dollars to each family that lost a member in Monday&#8217;s tragedy.</p>
<p>Rains lashed many parts of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Puducherry on Sunday, triggering waterlogging at several places including Chennai. A warning of heavy to very heavy rainfall has been put out in several towns, besides a flood alert for the people living in low lying areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Authorities in Tamil Nadu state and Puducherry have ordered the closure of schools and colleges on Monday, besides announcing postponement of examinations.</p>
<p>Meteorological department officials have forecast widespread rain across coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry due to a cyclonic circulation near Comorin on the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Authorities in Chennai said they were prepared to tackle any eventuality and people need not to panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Chennai, we have set up 176 relief centers. Boats have been kept ready to evacuate people if need arises and we have 600 dewatering pumps ready to clear the water-logged low-lying areas,&#8221; an official said. &#8220;We have also issued the helpline numbers for people in distress.&#8221;</p>
<p>India&#8217;s meteorological department said heavy to very heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu and surrounding areas was very likely to continue for the next two days.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Indian lawmakers raised serious concerns in the Indian Parliament on Monday over last week&#8217;s rape-and-murder case of a woman in India&#8217;s southern city of Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians cutting across party lines in both the Houses of Parliament &#8211; Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, called for stricter implementation of laws related to rape and crimes against women.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />In the gruesome case, several culprits allegedly first raped the woman, a veterinary doctor, on the night of Nov. 27 and then burnt her body. Her charred body was found the next morning under a bridge near Shamshabad area of Hyderabad, the capital city of southern state of Telangana.</p>
<p>Two days later four alleged culprits were nabbed by the local police, even as the hunt is on to arrest two more.</p>
<p>Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu said there was an urgent need for a strong political will to implement the existing laws concerning crimes against women to curb the social evil of rapes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Top managements of Bangladesh&#8217;s banks have agreed to bring down their industrial lending rate to single-digit and lessen the amount of classified loans shortly.</p>
<p>The consensus came in a meeting of the chairmen and managing directors of both public and private sector banks with Finance Minister A H M Mustafa Kamal at his Sher-e-Bangla Nagar office in the capital on Sunday.</p>
<p>The finance minister, flanked by Prime Minister&#8217;s Private Industry and Investment Adviser Salman Fazlur Rahman and the Bangladesh Bank (BB) Governor Fazle Kabir, expressed hope that the amount of classified loans in banking sector will come down by December 31.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hours after the meeting, the central bank formed a seven-member high-powered committee, headed by its deputy governor S M Moniruzzaman, to find out ways for bringing down the industrial lending rate to single-digit shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The single-digit interest rate on such lending will come into effect from January 01, 2020,&#8221; the finance minister told the reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Representatives from the stakeholders concerned, including the BB as well as the public and private sector banks, will be included in the committee.</p>
<p>The committee will submit its report to the BB governor within a week, and the final decision will be taken within the second week of this month, he also said.</p>
<p>The committee&#8217;s decisions will be communicated through issuing a circular or notification.</p>
<p>Regarding the amount of non-performing loans (NPLs), the minister expected that it will decrease by the end of December following implementation of the BB&#8217;s recent circular relating to special policy on loan rescheduling and one-time exit.</p>
<p>On May 16, the central bank offered a special facility to loan defaulters, allowing them to reschedule their loans for a maximum period of 10 years by paying 2.0 per cent down-payment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of NPLs would not rise further. At the same time it cannot be cut overnight, as the court verdict on the issue came in favour of us,&#8221; the minister noted.</p>
<p>The volume of default loans jumped by nearly 24 per cent to Tk 1,162.88 billion, as on September 30, from Tk 939.11 billion, as on December 31, 2018, despite the BB&#8217;s close monitoring.</p>
<p>The minister also said the single-digit interest rate on lending will also help bring down the amount of NPLs.</p>
<p>When contacted, a senior official told the FE that two chairmen &#8211; one from public banks and another from private banks, and four managing directors (MDs) and chief executive officers (CEOs) &#8211; one from public banks and three from private banks &#8211; have been included in the new committee.</p>
<p>The committee will also consider ensuring profitability of the banks (after implementing single-digit lending rate), according to the BB official.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also want to bring down the interest rate on lending to single-digit from the existing level to facilitate the country&#8217;s economic growth,&#8221; Syed Mahbubur Rahman, Chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB), told the FE after the meeting.</p>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 officially opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. (Xinhua)</p>
<p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement amid unclear prospects and challenges to multilateralism.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began with a warning from Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): &#8220;If we continue as we are doing, we run the risk of increasing the temperature of the planet and that will have an effect and terrible consequences for humanity and threaten our existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not doing enough and we are not even getting close to what we need to do to control this situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the world would need &#8220;solidarity and flexibility to win the war against climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guterres explained that there is only one way to control the temperature of the planet and that was &#8220;limited use of fossil fuels. If we don&#8217;t do that we will end up in a catastrophic situation,&#8221; he warned, before praising the work of young climate activists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young people are telling the leaders that they need to fight against the climate emergency,&#8221; commented the UN chief.</p>
<p>The conference is hosted by the Spanish capital after Chile, which presides over the event, had to step down as host due to social unrest.</p>
<p>Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez welcomed delegates to Spain, saying &#8220;Madrid will be the world capital of the fight against the climate emergency &#8230; But above all we want to be the capital of dialogue between nations united against a common enemy for all humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that although the event was being held in Spain, it is being presided over by Chile. &#8220;This is Chile&#8217;s COP: it is Chile that has organized the leadership and that has worked for an alliance against climate change and the success of this event will belong to Chile.&#8221;</p>
<p>TIME FOR ACTION</p>
<p>The major task for the delegates is to discuss Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the measures to promote voluntary international cooperation by paying a price on carbon, emission trading schemes and other market mechanisms.</p>
<p>The conference comes as global efforts to mitigate climate change are on the brink of failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global contributions to climate change fall far short,&#8221; said Berthold Kuhn, an expert on sustainable development with the Free University of Berlin and senior advisor to the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute.</p>
<p>According to a UN Environment Programme report on the emissions gap published last week, countries have collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.</p>
<p>The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5 percent per year in the last decade. In 2018, emissions totaled 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than the 1.5 degree goal set in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This critical situation has prompted the conference, which will last till Dec. 13, to choose &#8220;Time for Action&#8221; as its motto.</p>
<p>Kuhn believes that market mechanisms should be well designed to stimulate investment in projects like reforestation and other climate-friendly economic activities. Therefore, COP25 is of great importance to implement the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>COOPERATION CRUCIAL</p>
<p>The event comes after the United States formally initiated its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement earlier last month, impacting global cooperation on climate change with its unilateral move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be more difficult for the world to stop climate change by reducing the annual emissions effectively to zero without the United States,&#8221; said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>
<p>World leaders and experts are using COP25 as a venue for promoting multilateralism. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, joined the event on Monday, saying that &#8220;if we work together, we will go faster and we will be as ambitious as possible in the COP negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China&#8217;s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told reporters on Sunday that China will try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,&#8221; said Lu, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success.&nbsp;</p>
