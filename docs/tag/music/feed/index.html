<p>US microblogging and social networking website Tumblr just released its 2019 review report on the K-pop industry. Boy band BTS topped the chart for &#8220;most talked-about&#8221; idol group, while its seven members claimed the first seven spots on the K-pop stars chart, starting with Jeon Jung-kook at No.1 for his second year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the third time that BTS has topped the Tumblr charts. The site generates the results through its &#8220;Fandometrics&#8221; calculations, which compiles tag data and posts about K-pop stars and groups on its website to understand how much they are talked about.</p>
<p>The news of BTS&#8217;s feat quickly spread to China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Members of the Chinese ARMY (the name for BTS fans) took to social media to express their excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;That is BTS! Every member is on the chart!&#8221; wrote netizen Youyu on Sina Weibo.</p>

<br />The latest issue of Nylon magazine&#8217;s Chinese edition recently hit newsstands featuring Chinese boy band WayV star Lucas on the cover. Twitter reaction from the teen idol&#8217;s global following has served as a proof of the band&#8217;s international appeal.</p>
<p>Huang Xuxi, known by his fans as &#8220;Lucas,&#8221; was born in Hong Kong in 1999 to a Chinese father and Thai mother. At 18, he began his singing career after he signed with the South Korean conglomerate SM Entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, Lucas made his singing debut as a member of NCT. For 2019, he has performed with other SM idol acts like WayV and SuperM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having produced several albums as a member of WayV, the boyband superstar is also a frequent guest on popular Chinese variety shows, including &#8220;Day Day Up,&#8221; and &#8220;Happy Camp.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Renowned Latvian maestro Mariss Jansons, who conducted some of the world&#8217;s most prestigious orchestras, has died at his home in Saint Petersburg, Russian authorities said on Sunday. He was 76.</p>
<p>Jansons, who had suffered from heart problems, died of cardiac arrest, according to people close to his family quoted by Russian media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sincere gratitude for his great art will always remain with us,&#8221; Saint Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov said in a statement, calling him &#8220;an outstanding conductor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considered one of the leading conductors to emerge from the former Soviet Union, Jansons was born in the Latvian capital Riga in 1943, the son of the renowned conductor Arvid Jansons, who died in 1984.</p>
<p>The family moved to Leningrad, the present-day Saint Petersburg, in 1956, where he studied violin, piano and conducting at the conservatory.</p>
<p>Jansons also studied under world-famous conductors Herbert von Karajan and Yevgeny Mravinsky.</p>
<p>He had directed the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra since 2003 after leading other well-known ensembles such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>A highly valued guest conductor, he collaborated with almost every major orchestra in the world in recent years.</p>
<p>He was also a part of the very exclusive club which conducted the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra for the New Year&#8217;s concert, chosen by the musicians themselves, in 2006, 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;We received the sad and shocking news of the death of Mariss Jansons this morning,&#8221; the Vienna Philharmonic said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The traditional music of various ethnic groups hailing from different places in China comprises the most original and pure aesthetic qualities of Chinese history. However, the precious national music that used to rely on vocal tradition to teach and pass it on to the next generation, is facing a crisis as it&#8217;s losing rapidly and might be on the verge of demise.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, a digital project of China&#8217;s intangible cultural heritage in music was launched recently. The project aims to systematically record and organize endangered traditional Chinese music through advanced digital technology, and infuse a new spirit into the lively and vital traditional music. The music will be available on http://sound.china.cn.</p>
<p>The project will build an internet-based communication platform for valuable musical resources andaim to promote it to the world.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chinese boy band R1SE Photo:VCG</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The first episode of Chinese boy band R1SE’ variety show<br />
<em>Eleven Boys’ Autumn</em> debuted on Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video on Sunday. The six-episode program will see the 11 members meet with the young people that inspired the six songs released on their second EP<br />
<em>Boom!Rhapsody!</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The band is composed of the winners of survival reality show<br />
<em>Produce Camp 2019</em>. Debuting on the show on June 8, the eleven members of the temporary band will perform music and take part in programs and activities as a group for two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The band name, R1SE, has a special meaning: R stands for run, 1 means NO.1, S is Sun and E stands for energy. The name of the band reflects the energetic and robust early adult life stage of the band’s members, the majority of whom were born after 2000.</p>
<p>Chinese idol production programs have been all the rage in recent years. One phenomenal success was<br />
<em>Idol Producer</em>&nbsp;in 2018, from which temporary band Nine Percent came into being. Although some members, like Cai Xukun and Chen Linong, earned tremendous fan support or noticeable fame, the group was mocked for a lack of unity and&nbsp;it was disbanded in October amid massive fan disappointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As another temporary group coming up as the music industry explores different development models for Chinese bands and temporary bands, R1SE has set clear goals and has worked hard to live up to fan expectations.</p>
<p>Most members of R1SE have abundant experience as idol trainees or were established entertainers before taking part in<br />
<em>Produce Camp 2019</em>. For example, team leader Zhou Zhennan debuted in 2017 after winning fourth place in another survival show,<br />
<em>The Coming One Season One</em>, and Yan Xujia starred in several dramas and films before debuting in R1SE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program producers emphasized that<br />
<em>Produce Camp 2019</em> was not for beginners but asked participants to demonstrate their professionalism as their goal was to push the industry to a higher level of excellence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report from Chinese media outlet Sansheng, Wajijiwa Entertainment CEO Long Danni revealed a detailed two-year development scheme for R1SE called the Sun Project. It includes filming R1SE documentaries, organizing eight fan meets, at least two concerts and two large variety shows and four smaller variety shows. Most important of all is that they plan to release 30 singles, a good sign that the Chinese boy band values music instead of being obsessed with constant appearances on TV programs that have nothing to do with music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The orientation of the boy band is music creation. Their first EP,<br />
<em>Explode with Great Noises</em>, was highly welcomed by fans and set a record by earning 20 million yuan ($2.85 million) in pre-sales. The title of their second EP,<br />
<em>Boom!Rhapsody!</em>, also reflects the enthusiastic and energetic nature of these young men.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Eleven Boys’ Autumn</em> is R1SE’s first large variety show. In the first episode, the band’s members meet crosstalk comedians Guo Qilin and Tao Yang, who is also a Peking Opera performer, to learn more about traditional Chinese art performances. This lines up with the band’s second EP, which pays tribute to Peking Opera and combines traditional Chinese folk music with pop music.</p>
<p>It is not easy being a musician, especially as part of an idol group. Wajijiwa Entertainment’s Rocket Girls 101 is one of the most famous girl bands in China. On the last episode of<br />
<em>Produce Camp 2019</em>, Rocket Girls member Yang Chaoyue advised the members of R1SE to prepare for the upcoming difficulties they are sure to face after winning the survival show. The 11 young men seem very humble and dedicated to achieving their dreams to become outstanding entertainers. Whether or not they can establish a model for Chinese idol groups to follow remains unknown, but their current established plan certainly places them on the right path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>The Symphony Orchestra of the Central Conservatory of Music (CCOM) of Beijing will make its US debut on December 13 at New York City&#8217;s Carnegie Hall with a feast of modern Chinese music by master composers and performers.</p>
<p>The concert will present works composed by eight of China&#8217;s most distinguished living composers, including<br />
<em>Sleeve Dagger</em><br />
<em>and Warriors</em>,<br />
<em>Pipa Concerto</em> by Chen Danbu,<br />
<em>Listen to the Sounds of Nature</em> by Jia Guoping and<br />
<em>Black Light</em> by Chang Ping.</p>
<p>Internationally acclaimed musicians, including bamboo flute players Fan Linfeng and Dai Ya and pipa player Zhang Qiang, will perform as soloists at the concert.</p>
<p>Yu Feng, director of the orchestra who also serves as president of the CCOM, will conduct the concert in his Carnegie Hall debut.</p>
<p>Yu, who has given master classes at leading conservatories across the world, has collaborated with many orchestras at home and abroad, including the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Gulbenkian Orchestra in Portugal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Furthermore, the composers represent the best of the best in China; this is some of the most interesting music being written today. Each work on the program will offer a unique perspective on how the modern symphony orchestra can express a Chinese sensibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Escalating unrest in Hong Kong has further outraged Chinese netizens after several concerts and festivals scheduled in the city were canceled over safety concerns, including dates by local favorite Eason Chan and the Clockenflap annual music festival, which always attracts a raft of top international acts to the city.</p>
<p>Famous Hong Kong singer Eason Chan announced on Thursday on Chinese Twitter-like Sina Weibo and Facebook that a series of 25 concerts scheduled from December 9 to January 7 in Hong Kong, is canceled &#8220;in view of recent happenings&#8221; and because they &#8220;cannot predict and promise the safety of audience and the traffic conditions…,&#8221; read the announcement.</p>
<p>The cancelation came two days after a gig by Taiwan pop singer Jay Chou in Hong Kong was postponed due to the similar reasons, which made a big splash on social media.</p>
<p>Chan&#8217;s fans posted that they understand and support the decision and welcomed Chan to perform in the Chinese mainland as personal safety has been a big problem recently in Hong Kong, a city which has suffered months of anti-government protests which often escalated into violence and vandalism.</p>
<p>Fans even threatened on social media that they will form a group and come to Hong Kong to &#8220;give those rioters a lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many fans expressed their outrage toward the violent Hong Kong protesters who have destroyed their long-expected meeting with the idol and wasted their money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent HK$1,600 yuan [$204] buying a ticket which should cost HK$980 from scalpers and now I can only get a partial refund, which means I lost HK$620,&#8221; a fan surnamed Li based in Hong Kong told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>Clockenflap, Hong Kong&#8217;s biggest annual music and arts festival, which was due to be held at the Central Harbourfront Event Space from November 22 to 24 was also cancelled. &#8220;Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be canceled,&#8221; the organizer said on Facebook on November 15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netizens noted the cancelation by the unrest in the city not only caused losses to both organizers and fans in terms of time, efforts and costs, but also makes them concerned about the city&#8217;s future as an entertainment hub.</p>
<p>Observers said that as a melting pot of Eastern and Western cultures, Hong Kong is also considered a cultural center. However, the international metropolis has now descended into a culturally isolated island, said Tang Fei, a member of the Council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies.</p>
<p>The city right now is not suitable to hold large-scale cultural activities, especially activities favored by young people, a small section of whom are not rational and go to extremes to threaten public security, said Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan at Nankai University</p>
<p>Media reported that a concert by K-pop boy band GOT7 in Hong Kong, part of their world tour, which was scheduled for August 31 and September 1 was postponed.</p>
<p>2020 Hong Kong Formula E-Prix, a motorsport championship, was canceled in October over protest fears.</p>
