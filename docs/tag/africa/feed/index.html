<p>The Kenyan government on Tuesday confirmed that 132 people have lost their lives from rain-triggered disasters since October.</p>
<p>Cyrus Oguna, government spokesperson with Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology told journalists in Nairobi that the floods and landslides have affected 32 counties across the country, resulting in approximately 17,000 people being displaced.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the third month running, the country continues to experience unprecedented heavy rains which have triggered floods, mudslides and other calamities associated with bad weather,&#8221; Oguna said.</p>
<p>He noted that the humanitarian situation remains dire as an undetermined number of people have been marooned and are still cut off by the floods.</p>
<p>He observed that over 11,000 livestock have been swept away, with an undetermined acreage of farmlands left submerged.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government is currently implementing a number of interventions in collaboration with other actors such as the Red Cross, World Food Programme and other humanitarian agencies to assist the affected communities with food and non-food items.</p>

<p>In addition, Oguna said that a multi-agency team is assessing the extent of the damage on infrastructure and is currently undertaking repairs.</p>
<p>Oguna noted that the weather forecast has indicated that the current rains are not expected to cease until the end of December 2019 and so the government will continue monitoring the situation and undertaking appropriate intervention mechanisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are issuing an advisory that those living in the high-risk areas such as Lake Victoria Basin, Lower Tana Delta, Coastal and Central regions to move to safer areas,&#8221; said the government spokesman.</p>
<p>Additionally, he advised members of the public to avoid crossing flooded waters and avoid sheltering under trees and standing close to grilled windows to minimize safety risks from lightning strikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nigeria has started the construction of the country&#8217;s first transportation university assisted by a Chinese firm. </p>
<p>The construction of the new specialized academic institution on a 413-hectare of land is undertaken by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd, as part of its corporate social responsibility in the country. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday attended the project&#8217;s ground-breaking ceremony. </p>
<p>When completed, the University of Transportation in Daura, the birthplace of Buhari in Nigeria&#8217;s northern state of Katsina, will focus on research and development of human capital for the country&#8217;s transport sector. It is expected to mark a new level of growth, as well as economic and educational development in Africa&#8217;s largest economy. </p>

<p>The Nigerian leader, while noting the university as the first of its kind in Africa, said it will provide technical skills, enhance managerial capacity and pave way for innovation in Nigeria&#8217;s transport system, as well as create more job opportunities. </p>
<p>Buhari said the local transport sector in the country was in dire need of new thinking, skills, and investment, further assuring that the university will open up opportunities for economic growth. </p>
<p>&#8220;When established, the university would, among other things, pave way for the domestication of railway engineering and general transportation sciences in Nigeria, thereby bridging the technology and skill gap in the railway and ultimately transportation sector,&#8221; the president said. </p>
<p>He described the project as one which keys into the efforts of the Nigerian government &#8220;toward promotion and development of indigenous capacity through technology acquisition and knowledge transfer to effectively maintain and operate numerous railway infrastructure&#8221;. </p>
<p>The completion of the university&#8217;s construction is expected within 18 months. </p>
<p>Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria&#8217;s transport minister, told Xinhua in an interview that the project would go a long way to enhance the existing bilateral relationship between China and Nigeria, as well as encourage patronage of local content. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have talked about the transfer of technology. We have talked about the issue of maintenance&#8230; Being able to construct our own railways and knowledge transfer. That would be great,&#8221; Amaechi said. </p>

<p>Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony which had several top government functionaries in attendance, Zhou Pingjian, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria said the establishment of the University of Transportation was part of the ongoing effort of the Nigerian government to promote and develop the local capacity through technology acquisition in the rail transport sector. </p>
<p>Zhou also said China remained committed to working with Nigeria to implement the outcomes of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum On China-Africa Cooperation and advance the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative for common development. </p>
<p>In addition to the university&#8217;s construction, the CCECC is also currently training at least 150 young Nigerian students in railway engineering in China, as well as building a railway rolling stock assembly plant in Kajola, a town in the southwestern state of Ogun. </p>
<p>In an interview with Xinhua, Jiang Yigao, the managing director of CCECC Nigeria Ltd, which has been in operation in Nigeria since 1981, said the university project was done to fully establish the railway industry in the west African country. The Chinese firm has been handling most of Nigeria&#8217;s major railway projects, including the flagship rail modernization project. </p>
<p>&#8220;During the construction of Nigeria&#8217;s railway projects, we thought it was very important to train people, to transfer technology and to develop the industry of railway,&#8221; Jiang said. </p>
<p>&#8220;This transportation university can reach this target. The railway is in huge demand in Nigeria, especially for economic development,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Chinese medical mission, which continues to improve the health conditions of Cameroon, is &#8220;a pledge of friendship&#8221; between the two countries, Cameroonian Health Minister Malachie Manaouda said Monday.</p>
<p>Manaouda made the remarks during a ceremony to bid farewell to the 19th Chinese medical mission and welcome the 20th.</p>
<p>Chinese doctors have made &#8220;significant contribution in the care of the Cameroonian populations and in the transfer of knowledge for the benefit of our health personnel,&#8221; Manaouda said.</p>
<p>Wang Yingwu, Chinese ambassador to Cameroon, said that &#8220;the Chinese party is willing to further strengthen cooperation&#8221; with Cameroon in terms of public health in order to implement the health care initiative of the eight major initiatives proposed at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.</p>
<p>The 19th Chinese medical mission, during its one-year term, has treated more than 25,000 patients, performed over 500 surgeries, and traveled nine times to provide free services and medicines to vulnerable populations living in remote areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Faustin-Archange Touadera, President of the Central African Republic (CAR), has decorated six Chinese experts with insignia to honor their contribution to the nation&#8217;s agriculture development through the transfer of JUNCAO technology.</p>
<p>The six experts of the National Engineering Research Center of JUNCAO Technology at China&#8217;s Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University were awarded by the president with the insignia at a ceremony held here on Sunday that celebrated the country&#8217;s 61st National Day.</p>
<p>In March this year, Lin and his team came to CAR to transfer free of charge to the local farmers the JUNCAO technology. JUNCAO is a Chinese term which literally means &#8220;mushroom&#8221; and &#8220;grass&#8221;. JUNCAO technology has been used for the production of mushroom production, animal feed, and biomass fuel. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Mauritius on Monday picked former arts and culture minister Pritivirajsing Roopun as president of the island nation, a largely ceremonial post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His predecessor Ameenah Gurib-Fakim resigned in March 2018 after being embroiled in a scandal over her use of a credit card to buy luxury personal items. She denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In Mauritius, the prime minister is head of the government and holds most political power while the president is head of state but has no executive role and is considered the guardian of the constitution.</p>
<p>Roopun, 61, is a lawyer who was first elected to the National Assembly in 2000 and has been minister of regional administration, social integration, and arts and culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, Mauritius held elections which saw incumbent Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth win a new five-year term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since attaining independence from Britain in 1968, Mauritius has become one of the most stable countries in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It developed from a poor, agriculture-based economy into a prosperous economy striving to reach high-income status by 2025.</p>
<p>Driven by tourism &#8211; the islands boast pristine beaches and coral reefs &#8211; a textile industry and booming financial sector, the economy expanded at close to four percent in 2018.</p>
<p>But it is not without its troubles. Youth unemployment and inequality are growing problems, with joblessness at a stubborn 22 percent for young Mauritians. The gap between rich and the poor is also seen to be rising.</p>

<p>Expansion of the Hwange Thermal Power Station by China&#8217;s Sinohydro now stands at 25 percent, 14 months into the project which will add 600 megawatts into the national grid by 2022. </p>
<p>The 1.5 billion US dollars project entails the addition of two power generating units, Unit 7 and 8 to the existing 6 units that were commissioned between 1983 and 1987. </p>
<p>Along with many others at various stages of implementation, the project is part of Zimbabwe&#8217;s efforts to find sustainable solutions to its power challenges that are severely curtailing industrial growth and the economy at large. </p>
<p>In an update, the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) said most excavation work had been completed including for the cooling tower, the boiler house and the chimney, state news agency New Ziana reported Friday. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have completed all the excavations up to foundation level for Hwange 7 and 8. </p>
<p>&#8220;As of this month of November we have done 14 months into our schedule. Our current progress is around 25 percent and we are on target in terms of what we had planned to achieve up to month 14,&#8221; ZPC said. </p>
<p>The project will take up to 42 months to complete, but unit 7 is expected to start firing by April 2021 while unit 8 would follow later on. </p>
<p>Hwange Thermal Power Station is Zimbabwe&#8217;s largest coal-fired power generator with installed production capacity of 920 MW. </p>
<p>But due to old age, the plant&#8217;s current dependable capacity is around 600 megawatts. </p>
<p>In addition to the Kariba South Hydro-power Extension Project, which was completed in March 2018 also by Sinohydro, the Hwange expansion project is expected to substantially add to the national power grid and lift the nation out of the current power woes. </p>
<p>Zimbabweans are having to endure long hours of load shedding every day due to depressed generation capacity and limited ability to import power from regional neighbors.</p>

<p>Algeria&#8217;s Minister of Communication Hassane Rabehi on Saturday said that the European Parliament resolution about &#8220;the situation of liberties in Algeria&#8221; has exposed some European parliamentarians are attempting to disturb Algeria&#8217;s presidential election in December. </p>
<p>Rabehi stressed that &#8220;Algerian people have become aware of these heinous schemes and they are determined to participate in voting on December 12,&#8221; the official APS news agency reported. </p>
<p>He added that Algeria does not accept the interference of others in its internal affairs and this is an unchangeable principle in its policy. </p>
<p>The European Parliament on Thursday approved a resolution to express &#8220;deep concern over the human rights breaches and the lack of freedoms in Algeria,&#8221; as the country witnesses since Feb. 22 rallies demanding changes. </p>
<p>The resolution urges the Algerian government to &#8220;find a solution to the current (political) crisis based on a peaceful and open political path.&#8221; </p>
<p>Algeria will hold presidential election on Dec. 12 and five candidates, including two former prime ministers will compete for the presidency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The international community should present a common front to help South Sudan implement the 2018 peace deal, monitors tasked with overseeing the fragile pact said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Augostino Njoroge, chairperson of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), told a stakeholder meeting in Juba that time has come for the international community to speak with one voice and salvage the shaky pact from unraveling.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the 100 days already ticking, I urge the region and the international community to present a unified voice in support of the full and timely implementation of the peace agreement as we move forward,&#8221; Njoroge said.</p>
<p>The call came days after the U.S. recalled its envoy to South Sudan after the parties to the September 2018 agreement failed to meet the Nov. 12 deadline to a form unity government.</p>
<p>Njoroge said financial assistance and in-kind support is urgently needed to help the former foes to implement pending issues dragging back the agreement.</p>
<p>South Sudan descended into conflict in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy Machar leading to fighting between soldiers loyal to both leaders.</p>
