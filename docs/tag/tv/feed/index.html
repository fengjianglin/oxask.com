<p>The 46-episode-long Chinese costume drama<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em> (English:<br />
<em>Joy of Life</em>) adapted from a fictional web novel of the same title was released on November 26 on online streaming sites Tencent Video and iQIYI. It managed to receive a warm response from the audience and garnered a high rating of 8.0/10 on the Chinese media review platform Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only six episodes have come out until now which have been viewed over 420 million times on Tencent Video alone. The storyline of<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em> is set on a unique background of time leap, where a modern man in the contemporary era ailing with severe myasthenia is somehow bestowed with another life. In his reincarnation, he is born in the ancient era to a mysterious mother. The story goes on to chronicle how the infant with a modern man’s memories grows up and experiences all kinds of challenges of family battling for honors,<br />
<em>Jianghu</em> (community of martial artists in<br />
<em>wuxia</em> stories) and the imperial court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The high ratings of the web series can be attributed to the terrific castings. Highly revered veteran actors such as Chen Daoming and Wu Gang have displayed their prolific acting. The award-winning artists’ experience panning TV series, theatrical dramas, and films was evident as they played their parts in<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em>. Chen was elected the president of China Film Association in 2018 and was a household name for playing the role of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Chen&#8217;s role in<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em> is an emperor who is forbearing and determined and uses great tactics to rule diligently, besides striving to expand his empire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese actor Zhang Ruoyun from yesteryears who plays the protagonist in<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em> is not only a popular star but also a stalwart. With his handsome looks and proficient acting, Zhang presented the audience with an energetic and clever young man inquisitive toward his unknown destiny.</p>
<p>A large number of Chinese viewers are particularly attracted to the show because of Xiao Zhan’s role in it. Xiao is one of the most popular Chinese actors in the present day. His popularity burgeoned after playing Wei Wuxian in the successful show<br />
<em>The Untamed</em>. Although Xiao didn’t play a lead character, he lent his voice to the closing song of<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em>. His fans are delighted to hear him sing. It’s interesting to note that Xiao Zhan debuted in the entertainment arena as a singer.</p>
<p>The series releases two episodes at 8 pm every Monday through Wednesday. Meanwhile, the wait seems endless for the loyal fans of<br />
<em>Qing Yu Nian</em> as they were curiously asking for more updates on online forums.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />There were jokes galore from Chinese netizens on Sunday after it was revealed that actress Li Xiaolu and actor Jiang Jinfu would be playing the lead roles in the new drama<br />
<em>Love Me and Convince Me</em>. The hashtag #TheNewDramaCastingLiXiaoluAndJiangJinfu soon earned more than 420 million views on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Many netizens expressed their astonishment over the choice of leads, with some even joking that it was due to the two’s backgrounds that they were “kind of looking forward to watching it.”</p>
<p>The show, which finished shooting in 2016, is set to premiere next year, although many netizens were left wondering if it will make its 2020 date considering the drama surrounding the leads.</p>
<p>Scandals have caused both Li and Jiang to become the subject of heated online discussions in recent years. Amid rumors that she had an affair, the 38-year-old actress recently announced she had divorced her husband actor Jia Nailiang. In a livestream on December 31, 2017, Jia was asked by one viewer where his wife was. While Jia answered that she had gone to get her hair done, Photos of Li leaving the residence of a 25-year-old rapper in the early morning were soon leaked. Jiang has been at the center of accusations of physical abuse toward his girlfriends. The most recent accusations came from a Uruguay woman named Julieta, following those of Japanese model Haruka Nakaura in 2018.</p>
<p>An urban romance comedy,<br />
<em>Love Me and Convince Me</em> tells the story of a sharp-tongued female writer (Li) who falls in love with a handsome but complicated young man (Jiang).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese title of<br />
<em>Love Me and Convince Me</em> roughly translates to “You love this much, I’m going to take it seriously.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese netizens quickly began making up alternate titles for the show such as “You love cheating this much, I’m going to beat you” and “You love physical abuse this much, I’m going to cheat on you.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming latest episode of reality show<br />
<em>Encounter,</em> which will be made available on Tencent Video on Tuesday, will see Chinese musicians Aya, Tan Weiwei and Xiao He collect children&#8217;s folk songs in local dialects in Hangzhou and other neighboring areas in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passed down by word of mouth through the generations, children&#8217;s songs in local dialects are facing extinction due to rapid urbanization and social changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the show, the musicians seek out the original songs and then remake them&nbsp; to fit today&#8217;s modern times in order to remind people of the long-unheard voices of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second season of the show currently has a high rating of 7.6/10 on Chinese media review site Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s director Zhao Qi said that the second season, which kicked off on October 22, will &#8220;return to humanity itself.&#8221; The first season once raised questions about life and death, topics commonly discussed by many families.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Adele Haenel Photo: IC</p>
<p>French star Adele Haenel lodged a complaint on Tuesday against a film director she claims sexually harassed her between the ages of 12 and 15, her lawyers said.</p>
<p>The actress shook the French film industry earlier this month with accusations about being repeatedly touched and kissed by Christophe Ruggia, who directed her in her first film role.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old winner of two French Oscars initially refused to bring charges because she said so few sexual assault cases come to court in France. But she changed her mind and went to a police station in a Paris suburb on Tuesday to make a formal complaint against Ruggia.</p>
<p>The director, now 54, initially denied the accusations before asking Haenel to forgive him, saying: &#8220;I did not see that my adulation and the hopes I placed in her, might &#8211; given her young age &#8211; be distressing [for her].&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris prosecutors had already opened a preliminary investigation after she detailed the alleged abuse in a lengthy livestreamed interview to investigative website Mediapart.</p>
<p>The interview was seen as a turning point for the #MeToo movement in France. It helped galvanize renewed criticism of controversial director Roman Polanski, whose new film An Officer and a Spy was released in France earlier this month.</p>
<p>Polanski, who has French citizenship, has been a fugitive from US justice since 1978 after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in a plea bargain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days before his historical thriller opened, a French photographer claimed that Polanski had raped her in 1975 when she was 18 after beating her &#8220;into submission&#8221; at his Swiss chalet.</p>
<p>Valentine Monnier, a former model and actress, said she was pushed to finally speak out when the director compared himself to Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly persecuted as a spy by the French army at the turn of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">An app store featuring the Netflix app Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Streaming giant Netflix will use New York&#8217;s historic Paris theater, which had been shuttered earlier this year, for special events and screenings of its films &#8211; the latest twist in the company&#8217;s ongoing spat with the traditional film industry.</p>
<p>The theater &#8211; the city&#8217;s last single screen movie house, located in the heart of Manhattan on 57th Street, not far from Central Park and the Plaza hotel &#8211; closed in late August after 71 years in business.</p>
<p>It had reopened in early November for what seemed like a one-off event &#8211; a limited theatrical run for Netflix&#8217;s Oscar contender<br />
<em>Marriage Story</em> by New York director Noah Baumbach.</p>
<p>But it would seem that Netflix had bigger plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, the iconic theater will be kept open and become a home for special Netflix events, screenings, and theatrical releases,&#8221; the company said Monday in a series of Twitter messages.</p>
<p>The details of the deal were not disclosed, but industry site Deadline Hollywood said it was a 10-year lease agreement.</p>
<p>Netflix has been in a low-grade battle with traditional Hollywood for some time over the Oscar eligibility requirements that films in contention run in regular theaters for a certain period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many major theater chains have refused to deal with Netflix unless it consents to longer runs of its films &#8211; and a longer waiting period between any film&#8217;s theatrical release and its streaming debut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the waiting period generally agreed upon by studios and the major chains is 90 days.</p>
<p>That means Netflix has relied thus far on indie movie houses for its releases, but the leasing of the Paris theater would seem to mark a new phase in its strategy.</p>
<p>For months, it has reportedly been in talks to buy the historic Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.</p>
<p>On Monday, Deadline Hollywood reported that Netflix had indeed acquired a majority stake in that Los Angeles venue, but Netflix has yet to confirm the deal.</p>
<p>The Paris theater opened in 1948, when screen legend Marlene Dietrich cut the ribbon. It turned into one of the country&#8217;s most notable art house theaters, focusing on films often ignored by multiplexes.</p>

<p>A new TV drama<br />
<em>Without Knowing Dawn Break in the East</em> will debut in Sohu Video on December 25.</p>
<p>The legal romance drama will feature hot social topics such as sexual assault, celebrity image rights and professional ethics for lawyers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an adaptation of the popular legal romance novel of the same name by writer Ju Ziyi, the drama is sure to bring in fans of the novel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trailer and posters for the show were released on Tuesday. Chinese actor Wang Renjun and actress Zhang Jingjing will play the lead roles. Snippets of court room drama and gun battles were revealed in the one-minute trailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, dramas about forensic medicine, police, prosecutors and office life have become popular in China, but the slow development of legal drama has been a major topic of discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest birthday party the world has ever seen is being held this year as nearly 1.4 billion people across China are marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China with a year-long celebration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 44-minute documentary,<br />
<em>World&#8217;s Biggest Birthday Party</em>, was co-produced by the China Intercontinental Communication Center (CICC) with support from the National Geographic Channel and UK&#8217;s Meridian Line Films.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stories about China have been an important source of inspiration for our work. The rich history and culture of China has been continuously providing a bounty of material for our creations,&#8221; said Pei Yiqun, senior vice president of Walt Disney Company China (National Geographic is operated by Disney), at a launch ceremony for the documentary held on Tuesday in Beijing.</p>
<p>Pei also noted that they wanted to bring in National Geographic&#8217;s storytelling experience to tell China&#8217;s story in an international way that could reveal the real China to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on major events, the documentary looks back on the past seven decades through a dozen stories of ordinary people who have made extraordinary contributions. Tang Yutong, a martial arts student at the reputed Shaolin Temple, expresses his pride at performing in the 70th anniversary parade on October 1 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Li Guowei, a chef from Sichuan Province in Southwest China, known for its spicy food, decides to create a dish that brings together flavors across the country. A two-year-old toddler, You Ruiyi, and her family celebrates her birthday, which she shares with the country, as the military parade for the 70th anniversary plays on the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The show begins with a farmer in Panjin [Northeast China&#8217;s Liaoning Province] who has a big smile on her face,&#8221; said Ding Gang, a senior fellow of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting the film with a story related to agriculture does much to reveal the changes that have taken place throughout the country over the past 70 years,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Farmer, rural areas, agriculture, these words were closely related to toil and poverty in the past, and were a major component of the PRC, which was built from scratch 70 years ago. Yet now, they have become the basis for the happy life of 1.4 billion Chinese people,&#8221; Ding said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to bring the freshest messages, the liveliest images and the most touching stories of China to the world,&#8221; remarked Jing Shuiqing, vice president of CICC.</p>
<p>Jing also spoke highly of the efforts they undertook to boost the integration of media for the show. In addition to airing on broadcast channels, the documentary is also available on Chinese streaming platforms such as Bilibili, Youku, iQIYI and Kuaishou.<br />
