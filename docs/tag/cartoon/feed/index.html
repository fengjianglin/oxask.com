<p>Chinese-Canadian actor Godfrey Gao&#8217;s sudden death during the filming of a reality show has shocked his fans and triggered a debate on the suitability of television programs that imperil the lives of participants. Gao, 35, who was born in the island of Taiwan, died in the wee hours of Wednesday, while participating in the filming of a TV show which involves celebrities competing to undertake physically demanding tasks. Besides expressing heartfelt condolences, many netizens blasted the program for its &#8220;inhuman&#8221; setting. Many of the games on the show are too arduous for celebrities, for example, running two kilometers at one go and climbing a 70-meter-high building. Even professional athletes such as famous Chinese boxer Zou Shiming, who earlier participated in the show, found the tasks too tough. &#8220;Do you realize that the games are not at all suitable for ordinary people? Can you afford this consequence?&#8221; &#8220;What on earth is the meaning of the show?&#8221; comments read. The tragedy should be a reminder for many TV shows: No one should put the health and lives of participants at risk to gain audiences. Audiences will not buy it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is meant to help people by making tasks easier. But technology in its nascent state can be tricky. Many Chinese companies including telecom operators and banks have adopted artificial intelligence to man their service hotline for better customer experience. However, their Siri-like virtual assistants, almost all of which sound like challenged versions of the genuine one, would only upset the customers. Except for the response to simple words like &#8220;check my bill&#8221; and &#8220;internet doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; the so-called AI call-center executive would only repeat in a cold, robotic voice, &#8220;Sorry, I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; Companies intended to use high-tech to provide better service. For example, virtual assistants can drastically reduce the time a customer spends on one call. But where are the human receptionists when AI cannot properly serve the customers? Irritating customers with the use of high-tech will only backfire. Do these companies really care about their customers?</p>

<p>What would be your reason for leaving your job? That &#8220;I want to be as free as the wind&#8221; was how one Chinese lady born in 1998 put it. People&#8217;s Daily reported that generation Z quits their first job in seven months on average. Some even resign days after being recruited, with various causes, ranging from lack of passion or interests to complex interpersonal relations. Unlike the older generation, young people tend to attach more importance to their own feelings, especially concerned if their heart is in their work. They hardly value stability and prospects. However, it is quite normal that the work you do may not interest you. Even if one likes the work, one&#8217;s interest may wear away with time. While looking for a job or searching for another, youngsters should be careful in making decisions. Job-hoppers may reduce the chances of finding another job as employers like employees who are stable at the workplace. Meanwhile, on the other hand, employers had better make adjustments to help keep employees stay. If they neglect diverse requirements of the young, job-hopping will continue, adding to the cost of recruiting and training staff.</p>
