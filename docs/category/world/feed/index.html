<br />Greeks, Albanians and other migrants gathered in front of the City Hall and lit up candles in memory of the dead in an event organized by the Federation of Albanian Communities in Greece with the support of the Municipality of Athens.</p>
<p>The event, which aimed to send a strong message of friendship and solidarity with Albanian people in these difficult times, was also supported by the Greek forum of migrants comprised of communities of migrants from dozens of countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We remember the 51 people who lost their lives during the quake in our country and we are in pain. We want to do anything possible to help people who have lost their loved ones, especially for children who are in a serious psychological condition,&#8221; Anna Paschali, a 50-year-old Albanian migrant who has been living in Greece for the past 25 years, told Xinhua.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Paschali is a member of an organization mobilized to assist quake-devastated Albanians. They have collected clothing items, medicine and cash to be sent to the neighboring country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing whatever we can. I would like to voice our gratitude to the City of Athens which helped us organize this event,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Governments at various levels in Greece are offering help, while labor unions, medical associations, NGOs, soccer clubs and ordinary citizens are collecting humanitarian aid to be sent to Albania.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a community here we are deeply touched by the assistance Greek people and the Greek government have provided from the first hours,&#8221; said Ermal Soulai, president of the Federation, referring to the Greek teams of experts dispatched to help rescue people from the debris.</p>

<p>Representing Albanian students in Greece, Skerdilaidi Agaliu, member of the Board of Directors in the Federation, visited Durres while search and rescue operations were still underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;The image of the town was tragic. It resembled a bombarded site. Without exaggeration a large part of the town has vanished,&#8221; he told Xinhua.</p>
<p>&#8220;(In) these difficult days, Europe and the country where we&#8217;ve been living in the past 30 years have shown that we are not alone,&#8221; Agaliu said.</p>
<p>Quake prone Greece has been hit numerous times by deadly tremors and Greek people know the pain of losing relatives, friends, neighbors and properties within brief moments.</p>
<p>Albanians represent the largest immigrant population in Greece, according to the 2011 census. Mainly since the 1990s, hundreds of thousands have been seeking a better life in Greece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />The ruling party of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has decided to hold new sessions to &#8220;discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad,&#8221; official media reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers&#8217; Party of Korea (WPK) decided on Tuesday to convene the 5th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK in late December, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>
<p>The 4th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK was held on April 10 this year.</p>
<p>With the year-end deadline set by Pyongyang for diplomacy to produce results, DPRK&#8217;s Vice Foreign Minister Ri Thae Song warned on Tuesday that the U.S. will soon need to decide what kind of &#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> gift&#8221; it will receive from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get,&#8221; Ri said in a statement carried by the KCNA.</p>

<p>The Kenyan government on Tuesday confirmed that 132 people have lost their lives from rain-triggered disasters since October.</p>
<p>Cyrus Oguna, government spokesperson with Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology told journalists in Nairobi that the floods and landslides have affected 32 counties across the country, resulting in approximately 17,000 people being displaced.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the third month running, the country continues to experience unprecedented heavy rains which have triggered floods, mudslides and other calamities associated with bad weather,&#8221; Oguna said.</p>
<p>He noted that the humanitarian situation remains dire as an undetermined number of people have been marooned and are still cut off by the floods.</p>
<p>He observed that over 11,000 livestock have been swept away, with an undetermined acreage of farmlands left submerged.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government is currently implementing a number of interventions in collaboration with other actors such as the Red Cross, World Food Programme and other humanitarian agencies to assist the affected communities with food and non-food items.</p>

<p>In addition, Oguna said that a multi-agency team is assessing the extent of the damage on infrastructure and is currently undertaking repairs.</p>
<p>Oguna noted that the weather forecast has indicated that the current rains are not expected to cease until the end of December 2019 and so the government will continue monitoring the situation and undertaking appropriate intervention mechanisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are issuing an advisory that those living in the high-risk areas such as Lake Victoria Basin, Lower Tana Delta, Coastal and Central regions to move to safer areas,&#8221; said the government spokesman.</p>
<p>Additionally, he advised members of the public to avoid crossing flooded waters and avoid sheltering under trees and standing close to grilled windows to minimize safety risks from lightning strikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nigeria has started the construction of the country&#8217;s first transportation university assisted by a Chinese firm. </p>
<p>The construction of the new specialized academic institution on a 413-hectare of land is undertaken by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd, as part of its corporate social responsibility in the country. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday attended the project&#8217;s ground-breaking ceremony. </p>
<p>When completed, the University of Transportation in Daura, the birthplace of Buhari in Nigeria&#8217;s northern state of Katsina, will focus on research and development of human capital for the country&#8217;s transport sector. It is expected to mark a new level of growth, as well as economic and educational development in Africa&#8217;s largest economy. </p>

<p>The Nigerian leader, while noting the university as the first of its kind in Africa, said it will provide technical skills, enhance managerial capacity and pave way for innovation in Nigeria&#8217;s transport system, as well as create more job opportunities. </p>
<p>Buhari said the local transport sector in the country was in dire need of new thinking, skills, and investment, further assuring that the university will open up opportunities for economic growth. </p>
<p>&#8220;When established, the university would, among other things, pave way for the domestication of railway engineering and general transportation sciences in Nigeria, thereby bridging the technology and skill gap in the railway and ultimately transportation sector,&#8221; the president said. </p>
<p>He described the project as one which keys into the efforts of the Nigerian government &#8220;toward promotion and development of indigenous capacity through technology acquisition and knowledge transfer to effectively maintain and operate numerous railway infrastructure&#8221;. </p>
<p>The completion of the university&#8217;s construction is expected within 18 months. </p>
<p>Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria&#8217;s transport minister, told Xinhua in an interview that the project would go a long way to enhance the existing bilateral relationship between China and Nigeria, as well as encourage patronage of local content. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have talked about the transfer of technology. We have talked about the issue of maintenance&#8230; Being able to construct our own railways and knowledge transfer. That would be great,&#8221; Amaechi said. </p>

<p>Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony which had several top government functionaries in attendance, Zhou Pingjian, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria said the establishment of the University of Transportation was part of the ongoing effort of the Nigerian government to promote and develop the local capacity through technology acquisition in the rail transport sector. </p>
<p>Zhou also said China remained committed to working with Nigeria to implement the outcomes of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum On China-Africa Cooperation and advance the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative for common development. </p>
<p>In addition to the university&#8217;s construction, the CCECC is also currently training at least 150 young Nigerian students in railway engineering in China, as well as building a railway rolling stock assembly plant in Kajola, a town in the southwestern state of Ogun. </p>
<p>In an interview with Xinhua, Jiang Yigao, the managing director of CCECC Nigeria Ltd, which has been in operation in Nigeria since 1981, said the university project was done to fully establish the railway industry in the west African country. The Chinese firm has been handling most of Nigeria&#8217;s major railway projects, including the flagship rail modernization project. </p>
<p>&#8220;During the construction of Nigeria&#8217;s railway projects, we thought it was very important to train people, to transfer technology and to develop the industry of railway,&#8221; Jiang said. </p>
<p>&#8220;This transportation university can reach this target. The railway is in huge demand in Nigeria, especially for economic development,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Iran&#8217;s points of view, there is no problem in developing ties with neighbors and resuming relations with Saudi Arabia,&#8221; Rouhani made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi in Tehran. </p>
<p>&#8220;All the regional countries should stay together in order to create peace and stability in the region,&#8221; Rouhani was quoted as saying. </p>
<p>The Iranian president said that Iran&#8217;s Hormuz Peace Initiative is aimed at bringing regional countries together to create stability. </p>
<p>&#8220;We should establish security in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz through expanding our cooperation and preventing foreign powers to interfere,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Rouhani disclosed the initiative at the recent meeting of the 74th UN General Assembly. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Rouhani said that &#8220;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon failed to bear fruits.&#8221; He urged the Saudi authorities to change their course of action vis-a-vis regional countries. </p>
<p>Rouhani noted that Iran and Saudi Arabia need to leave aside their feud and look ahead to solve regional problems through cooperation.</p>

<p>The Russian Navy will receive more than 480 units of military equipment and armament this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with top defense industry managers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The list includes two submarines, 23 surface ships and support vessels, three aircraft, four coastal missile systems and more than 400 units of various missile and torpedo weapons,&#8221; Putin said.</p>
<p>He added that Russian naval strategic nuclear forces are being re-equipped with modern Borei-class submarines with Bulava ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>According to Putin, the upgraded Borei-A-class submarine Prince Vladimir is undergoing final tests, with four more under construction.</p>
<p>Ships equipped with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles form the basis of the Navy&#8217;s strategic non-nuclear forces, Putin said.</p>
<p>These missiles are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 1,500 kilometers, he said, adding Russia plans to more than double the number of these missiles by 2023.</p>
<p>Putin said that the pace of equipping the fleet with maritime zone ships is accelerating, with the construction of nine surface ships of this class currently underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, we will continue to develop the Navy, making it modern, ocean-going and highly efficient,&#8221; Putin added.&nbsp;</p>

<br />More than 500 Syrian refugees returned on Tuesday to their homeland from Lebanon, the National News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Syrian refugees from different areas in Lebanon, including Burj Hammoud, Tripoli, Bekaa, Nabatieh and other regions, returned to their homeland by bus under the supervision of the Lebanese general security.</p>
<p>More than one million Syrian refugees are registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon, while the Lebanese government estimated the true number of Syrians in the country at 1.5 million.</p>
<p>Lebanese President Michel Aoun has been working hard with the international community to secure the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland due to the negative impact of their stay in Lebanon on the national economy.</p>
<p>The president has previously announced that around 390,000 Syrian refugees have so far returned to Syria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />US House Democrats on Tuesday released a draft report summarizing their findings from an ongoing impeachment inquiry into US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The impeachment inquiry, initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in late September, has found that Trump, &#8220;personally and acting through agents within and outside of the US government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection,&#8221; the report claimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There remain unanswered questions, and our investigation must continue,&#8221; according to the 300-page report that also called evidence of Trump&#8217;s alleged misconduct and obstruction of Congress &#8220;overwhelming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, drafted by staff of the Democrat-led House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees, will be transmitted to the lower chamber&#8217;s Judiciary panel, which is expected to take over the impeachment inquiry after the Intelligence panel led by Chairman Adam Schiff voted to issue it this evening.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement in response to the report, accusing it of reflecting nothing more than &#8220;frustrations&#8221; from Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,&#8221; Grisham said. &#8220;Chairman Schiff&#8217;s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump, who&#8217;s in London for a NATO summit, slammed the impeachment inquiry and Schiff earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a disgrace. I think the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves,&#8221; Trump told reporters during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. &#8220;I learned nothing from Adam Schiff. I think he&#8217;s maniac. I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a joint statement following the draft report&#8217;s public release, Schiff and two other Democratic chairs alleged Trump&#8217;s actions &#8220;have damaged our national security, undermined the integrity of the next election, and violated his oath of office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have also challenged the very core of our Constitutional system of checks and balances, separation of powers, and rule of law,&#8221; the Democrats said. &#8220;It will be up to the Congress to determine whether these acts rise to the level of an impeachable offence.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically. Lawmakers are also examining whether the Republican tied a White House meeting or aid for Ukraine to those investigations.</p>
<p>Their report was a result of a fast-moving investigation based on interviews with 17 current and former Trump administration officials who had offered their narratives of the White House&#8217;s handling of its Ukraine policy.</p>
<p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing or a &#8220;quid pro quo.&#8221; The White House has refused to cooperate with the inquiry, accusing Democrats of an unfair process and a partisan attempt to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee unveiled on Monday the four legal experts for its first hearing on Wednesday as part of the Trump impeachment inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to discuss the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry,&#8221; the Committee&#8217;s Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a letter to Trump last week.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat also said they will discuss whether Trump&#8217;s alleged actions &#8220;warrant the House&#8217;s exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor his counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to attend Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. In a letter to Nadler on Sunday, Cipollone said the White House won&#8217;t participate in the hearing, citing concern that the House panel won&#8217;t afford Trump &#8220;a fair process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president will be impeached if the House approves any of the articles of impeachment that the House Judiciary Committee has recommended by a simple majority vote.</p>
<p>But conviction can only happen in the Senate and requires at least two-thirds of its members, or 67 senators, to vote in favorEnditem</p>

<p>Spain&#8217;s new parliament met for its opening session Tuesday, with the far-right Vox as the third-largest party following a divisive election that failed to resolve years of deadlock.</p>
<p>Just over three weeks ­after the vote, lawmakers were on Tuesday taking the oath of ­office, although there was little indication of when a government would be formed.</p>
<p>The legislature has been gridlocked since an inconclusive April election which the Socialists won but without a majority &#8211; in an outcome repeated on November 10, leaving Pedro Sanchez a winner but weakened. This time, Vox more than doubled its showing, snaring 52 of the parliament&#8217;s 350 seats.</p>
<p>Just days after the election, Sanchez and the radical left-wing Podemos agreed in principle to form a coalition government in what would be the first such power-sharing deal in the country&#8217;s modern history.</p>
<p>Such a government would only have 155 seats, leaving it dependent on support from other factions to pass an investiture vote for which it would need a minimum of 176.</p>
<p>Sanchez&#8217;s negotiating team began talks with the Republican Left of Catalonia, a Catalan separatist party which won 13 seats in November&#8217;s election but has so far refused to offer its backing. In exchange for support, the party wants talks on the Catalan crisis, which would likely touch on its demand for a referendum on self-determination, an issue completely ruled out by Madrid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chile launched a massive $5.5 billion stimulus package after data showed its economy contracted 3.4 percent in October &#8211; the largest year-on-year drop in a decade &#8211; as widespread social unrest continues.</p>
<p>The package unveiled by ­Finance Minister Ignacio Briones on Monday includes boosting 2020 public spending by $3.03 billion, to support small, medium and large businesses.</p>
<p>Another $525 million are earmarked for other initiatives like the renovation of the metro system in Santiago, which has sustained serious damage since protests erupted on October 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;Estimates show that this agenda will generate 100,000 new jobs next year,&#8221; Briones said.</p>
<p>But the measures will mean a real increase in public spending next year of 9.8 percent as compared to 2019, pushing the fiscal deficit up to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The government announced the stimulus measures after the central bank reported the ­worrisome GDP figures for October.</p>
<p>The 3.4 percent drop was far greater than the 1 percent decrease anticipated in official estimates, and represented the economy&#8217;s worst performance since 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Protests broke out across the country on Monday night, the 46th consecutive day of demonstrations. In Santiago, protesters gathered in the Plaza Italia, a main hub for the city&#8217;s rallies, and dozens of young people broke into different metro stations.</p>
<p>Protests initially erupted in mid-October over metro fare hikes but quickly escalated into the most severe outbreak of social unrest since the end of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.</p>
<p>Furious Chileans have taken to the streets to protest social and economic inequality. Businesses have remained closed during the period of unrest, public transport came to a halt, and many people worked ­shorter days.</p>
<p>At least 23 people have been killed, including five at the hands of security forces, and more than 2,000 were ­wounded.</p>
