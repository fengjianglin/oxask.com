<p>Chinese netizens denounced Zhejiang TV station (Zhejiang STV) for its response to the death of Taiwan island actor Godfrey Gao, and posted 20 questions on the official Sina Weibo account for Gao&#8217;s fans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Weibo account &#8220;Gao Yixiang ba�?posted 20 questions and called on Zhejiang STV to give a public reply to Gao&#8217;s death in the show &#8220;Chase Me&#8221; on November 27.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Gao&#8217;s body was finally returned home six days after the incident. Zhejiang STV only gave an explanation to the public by posting two announcements without an official seal and used money to influence public opinion, divert attention and cover it up. We don&#8217;t want your hypocritical apology. We want the truth!�?the post read. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 20 questions are about the reasons why the TV station did not conduct more timely rescue efforts when Gao fell to the ground and their delayed response to the whole incident.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The hashtag of 20 questions to Zhejiang STV has gained 850 million views on Weibo and many Chinese netizens commended Weibo for asking the station to give a proper reply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Do you still have a conscience? For the recording effect of the program, Gao fell down but you continued to record the program and missed the golden rescue time. We need the truth,�?one netizen said <a name="_GoBack"></a>on Weibo.</span></p>

<p>Zhang Jinlai, 60, better known by his stage name Liu Xiao Ling Tong, was the best Monkey King in the eyes of a lot of Chinese who grew up watching the 1986 TV series<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em> and its later 2000 sequel. The star recently announced on Sina Weibo that he will return to the role for an upcoming movie version of the classic story, causing droves of Chinese netizens to wax nostalgic on social media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My happiest time in the day was when I could sit in front of the TV and watch<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em> with my parents after dinner,&#8221; commented one netizen on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s compelling performance in<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em> was greatly praised by critics and helped him win the Best Actor award at the sixth Golden Eagle Awards in 1988.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese netizens congratulated and gave their blessings to South Korean singer and actress Jeon Hye-bin after the news that she would be getting married on Saturday hit the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations! Hope you will be happy all the time,&#8221; a Sina Weibo user commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all fans, however, were ecstatic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she can find her own happiness, but I really don&#8217;t want to accept the reality that she will be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actress&#8217;s performance in<br />

<p>Argentine soccer player Lionel Messi, who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team, was awarded his sixth Golden Ball Award on Monday, setting a new record for a player with the most number of wins.</p>
<p>Chinese netizens congratulated Messi and said he deserves the award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Messi, a man like a god,&#8221; &#8220;Congratulations! Please stay healthy and continue to play brilliantly,&#8221; Sina Weibo users wrote congratulating the star athlete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides his fame in the field of soccer, Messi has also been praised for his humble nature and showing love for his family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;His reputation comes naturally from his real distinction. He is my model both professionally and in life,&#8221; posted one netizen on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">US First Lady Melania Trump Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Melania Trump has a White House suite of her own, is less than chummy with first daughter Ivanka, and uses her wardrobe to make statements, a new biography about the US first lady says.</p>
<p><em>Free, Melania</em>, an unauthorized look at US President Donald Trump&#8217;s wife by CNN reporter Kate Bennett, was just released on Tuesday, but already has official Washington buzzing about its contents.</p>
<p>At 49, and three years into her husband&#8217;s administration, the Slovenia-born ex-model remains genuinely private and &#8220;mysterious&#8221; to much of the public, while acutely aware of all that is said about her and her husband, says Bennett.</p>
<p>But she is hardly the docile third wife of an extremely powerful man accused of being a serial womanizer, the author writes.</p>
<p>Instead, Melania Trump is prepared to let her husband know what she thinks &#8211; and to use her sharp elbows when she feels slighted.</p>
<p>The first lady is &#8220;way more powerful and influential with her husband&#8221; than the public knows, Bennett says.</p>
<p>The author confirms reports in 2018 that Melania Trump was responsible for the firing of a senior White House national security official, Mira Ricardel, after the first lady felt slighted during a October 2018 trip to Africa.</p>
<p>The book also confirms that the first lady lives in a two-room suite on the third floor of the White House &#8211; one floor up from the president&#8217;s master bedroom.</p>
<p>The suite offers her extra space to do her hair and makeup. She also has an exercise room with a Pilates machine.</p>
<p>In another revelation, Bennett said the kidney treatment that led to Melania Trump&#8217;s 25-day absence from public view in 2018 was much more serious and painful than previously revealed.</p>
<p>While she speaks little in public, the first lady finds her voice in her clothes, Bennett says.</p>
<p>That was clear when she donned an olive green Zara coat in June 2018 with the words &#8220;I REALLY DON&#8217;T CARE, DO U?&#8221; on the back.</p>
<p>Some thought it was an attack on President Trump&#8217;s policies toward migrant children, and by others as a brickbat for the press.</p>
<p>But Bennett says it in fact was directed at step-daughter Ivanka Trump, who Melania Trump sees as sometimes usurping the first lady&#8217;s role.</p>
<p>Their relationship is described in the book as &#8220;cordial, not close.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bennett also says that when Melania Trump wears pantsuits and other menswear styles, it signals unhappiness with her husband, &#8220;because Trump notoriously likes to see women in tight, short, ubersexy and feminine dresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each thing she does has meaning to it, even the clothing she wears,&#8221; writes Bennett.</p>
<p>The book does not have any direct input from the first lady, whose husband has declared Bennett&#8217;s network an enemy of his administration.</p>
<p>It labels the first lady&#8217;s &#8220;Be Best&#8221; campaign against bullying a poorly executed flop, but otherwise is generally positive.</p>
<p>Bennett, whose beat is first lady and the Trump family, appears to be deeply sympathetic to Melania Trump, who is often painted as a prisoner of her husband by his critics.</p>
<p>That view spawned the online meme &#8220;Free Melania&#8221; &#8211; and inspired the book&#8217;s cryptic title.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t need freeing of any kind,&#8221; says Bennett.</p>

<p>A US woman who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew criticized the royal&#8217;s &#8220;ridiculous excuses&#8221; in an interview aired on Monday.</p>
<p>The interview was recorded before Andrew&#8217;s own BBC interview, which prompted him to stand down from public duties because of a backlash at his defense of his friendship with Epstein.</p>
<p>But Virginia Giuffre called on the British public to support her as she dismissed claims initially made by the prince&#8217;s backers that a photograph apparently showing him with his arm around her might not be genuine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored,&#8221; she told the BBC&#8217;s<br />
<em>Panorama</em> program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m calling BS [bullshit] on this. He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there&#8217;s only one of us telling the truth,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real photo. I&#8217;ve given it to the FBI for their investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew himself doubted the authenticity of the photograph during his interview, saying &#8220;nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giuffre has alleged she was trafficked to have sex with friends of Epstein when she was 17. Epstein was found dead in a New York prison in August awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She described how Epstein preyed on her once he knew she came from a vulnerable background, having already suffered sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The financier initially lured her with an offer as a job as a masseuse, but soon began abusing her, according to Giuffre.</p>
<p>She accused Epstein of bringing her to London in 2001, where she was introduced to Andrew and Epstein&#8217;s socialite girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prince asked her for a dance at a nightclub, she recalled, telling<br />
<em>Panorama</em> he was &#8220;the most hideous dancer I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;His sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just like grossed out from it but I knew I had to keep him happy because that&#8217;s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ill-judged&#8217; friendship<br /></strong><br />
<br />The prince told the BBC he was unable to sweat at the time due to a medical condition he developed after serving as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands War in 1982.</p>
<p>After the nightclub, Giuffre &#8211; then known as Roberts &#8211; said that Maxwell told her: &#8220;I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She and Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s second son later had sex at Maxwell&#8217;s house in central London, she alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was disgusting,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said &#8216;thanks&#8217; and walked out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew, 59, said he did not remember meeting Giuffre and that he &#8220;absolutely and categorically&#8221; did not have sex with her.</p>
<p>But an email discovered by<br />
<em>Panorama</em> appeared to show Andrew writing to Maxwell in 2015 with &#8220;specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.&#8221;</p>
<p>She replied &#8220;have some info &#8211; call me when you have a moment,&#8221; according to the BBC investigation.</p>
<p>Giuffre admitted to having a &#8220;foggy memory&#8221; over dates and places when she was asked about inconsistencies in her story.</p>
<p>But she added: &#8220;I implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being OK.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked. This is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guy&#8217;s royalty.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Panorama</em> reported that Andrew could be served with subpoenas if he returns to the US, with lawyers for five of Epstein&#8217;s victims demanding that the prince testify in their court cases abut how he witnessed people being given massages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After his BBC interview, Andrew issued a statement in which he said &#8220;I&#8230; unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein&#8221; and &#8220;deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement from Buckingham Palace said they &#8220;emphatically denied that The Duke of York [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Panorama</em> also interviewed another of Epstein&#8217;s victims, who made further allegations against Maxwell.</p>
<p>Sarah Ransome told the program that she &#8220;controlled the girls&#8230; like the madam.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bottega Veneta and its young artistic director Daniel Lee were the big winners at the 2019 Fashion Awards on Monday, taking four awards in a star-studded ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London.</p>
<p>The Italian fashion house which specializes in high-end leather goods just last year named the 33-year-old Briton as creative director of the brand.</p>
<p>It was mission accomplished for the young Lee, with Bottega Veneta &#8211; founded in 1966 in Vicenza &#8211; named &#8220;brand of the year&#8221; at the annual British Fashion Council gathering.</p>
<p>And Lee, who worked at Margiela, Balenciaga and Donna Karan before taking over management of Celine&#8217;s ready-to-wear collections for five years, was crowned &#8220;designer of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was also named &#8220;British designer of the year, womenswear&#8221; and took the award for best accessories designer.</p>
<p>It was validation for the previously little-known designer, who confided that: &#8220;As a child, I often felt like an outsider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbadian superstar Rihanna received the &#8220;urban luxe&#8221; award from fellow singer Janet Jackson for her young label Fenty, part of the LVMH galaxy.</p>
<p>Adut Akech, 19 and originally from South Sudan, was named model of the year.</p>

<p>Clive James, the Australian broadcaster, writer, critic and poet who charmed generations of Britons with his humor and wit, has died at the age of 80, his agents said Wednesday.</p>
<p>James died &#8220;peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family and his books&#8221; in Cambridge, eastern England, on Sunday, United Agents said in a statement.</p>
<p>A private funeral attended by family and close friends took place on Wednesday in the chapel at Pembroke College in Cambridge University, where he read English literature as a student in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The charismatic and erudite broadcaster, who left Sydney for England in late 1961 and made his career in Britain, had fought a long battle with leukemia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clive died almost 10 years after his first terminal diagnosis and one month after he laid down his pen for the last time,&#8221; UA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He endured his ever-multiplying illnesses with patience and good humor, knowing until the last moment that he had experienced more than his fair share of this &#8216;great, good world.'&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his name as The Observer newspaper&#8217;s TV critic for a decade from 1972, where he turned the TV review into somewhat of an art form.</p>
<p>His own hit TV show,<br />
<em>Clive James on Television</em>, fronted with his wise-cracking presenting style, put some the world&#8217;s most bizarre programs under the spotlight &#8211; notably clips of the Japanese game show<br />
<em>Endurance</em>.</p>
<p>Another regular guest was the Cuban singer Margarita Pracatan, who paid tribute on Wednesday to James&#8217; intelligence, talent &#8220;and beautiful way of living.&#8221;</p>
<p>James pioneered the &#8220;postcard&#8221; format of travel documentaries.</p>
<p>He retired from mainstream television in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Penned his own obituary</strong></p>
<p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), presented him with a special lifetime achievement award in 2015.</p>
<p>BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: &#8220;Clive James was a clever, witty and thought-provoking broadcaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a huge range of talents and everything he did was essential listening or viewing. He is irreplaceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>James wrote several novels and poetry books and received the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal, a major Australian literature award, in 2003.</p>
<p>He published several volumes of his memoirs, including<br />
<em>The Blaze of Obscurity</em> about his years in television.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek in February this year, James set about compiling an autobiographical anthology of poems called<br />
<em>The Fire Of Joy</em>, which was finished a month ago.</p>
<p>During his long illness, James penned his own obituary, regularly updating it on his website.</p>
<p>He said it would &#8220;serve as a cheaper obituary than anything most newspapers are likely to have in the freezer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will keep updating it until they carry me to the slab, during which journey I will try to give details of my final medication,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Miller dies, 85</strong></p>
<p>James&#8217; death was announced after the family of theater director Jonathan Miller said he died on Wednesday at the age of 85.</p>
<p>Miller once appeared as a guest on James&#8217; chat show<br />
<em>The Late Clive James</em> in 1988, in which he discussed his love of stationery.</p>
<p>The polymath first found fame in the early 1960s in the revue<br />
<em>Beyond The Fringe</em> with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.</p>
<p>Miller directed theater and television plays, including<br />
<em>The Merchant Of Venice</em> at the National Theatre and six of BBC television&#8217;s Shakespeare plays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our father died this morning peacefully at home with his family around him following a long battle with Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; Miller&#8217;s family said in a statement.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s National Theatre called Miller a &#8220;legendary figure across theater and opera,&#8221; while the English National Opera said &#8220;his contribution to comedy, theater and ENO in particular was immeasurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO&#8217;s most celebrated and popular opera productions.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct to turn himself in to face multiple charges related to allegations of sexual assault on Friday. According to reports, Weinstein is facing charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and first-degree criminal sex act in another case. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>A New York judge has ruled that<br />
<em>The Sopranos</em> actress Annabella Sciorra is allowed to testify at fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s trial, court documents showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a decision filed late Tuesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke also denied a last-ditch attempt by Weinstein&#8217;s attorneys to have predatory sexual assault charges against their client dropped.</p>
<p>Weinstein &#8211; once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood &#8211; has pleaded not guilty to five charges of sexual assault relating to two women.</p>
<p>His trial is scheduled to start on January 6, 2020. He faces life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>One of the women alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013, while the other claims he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.</p>
<p>His lawyers had sought to prevent prosecutors from calling a third woman, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein over the winter of 1993-94, to give evidence.</p>
<p>Burke rejected their request.</p>
<p>The woman is not named in court documents but it widely understood to be Sciorra, 59.</p>
<p>She helped trigger the #MeToo movement in October 2017 when she told The New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at her home in Manhattan in 1993.</p>
<p>Weinstein, 67, cannot be charged with raping Sciorra because the statute of limitations has expired. Prosecutors hope that her giving evidence as a corroborating witness will strengthen their case.</p>
<p>Weinstein has been accused of harassment and assault by more than 80 women, including stars such as Ashley Judd.</p>
<p>The co-founder of Miramax and producer of<br />
<em>Pulp Fiction</em>, has always insisted his sexual relationships were consensual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>Japanese chicken yakitori kebabs, one of the country&#8217;s most-loved fast foods, will soon be making an appearance in orbit after Japan&#8217;s space agency cleared them for astronaut meals.</p>
<p>The charbroiled chicken meat on skewers and flavored with a variety of sauces is hugely popular in Japan and abroad, and a canned version has just won certification as a &#8220;Japanese space food&#8221; for consumption on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Yakitori joins 34 other Japanese items such as onigiri rice balls, ramen noodles, seaweed soup and cooked mackerel, as Japanese astronauts pine for a taste of home while in orbit.</p>
<p>They can pick what certified Japanese food to bring on their ISS missions, adding to base meals selected by NASA, a spokesman from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) explained on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The approved yakitori will come in two flavors &#8211; soy sauce and yuzu kosho &#8211; green pepper infused with the Japanese citrus fruit yuzu.</p>
<p>But while astronauts may want the full yakitori experience of chewing from a bamboo skewer, strict space rules will make this impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating from skewers in space would be good&#8230; but the policy is to leave as little waste as possible,&#8221; the JAXA spokesman told AFP.</p>
<p>So the yakitori will be eaten from ring-pull cans with special velcro to keep it from floating away in the microgravity environment.</p>
<p>The approved yakitori cans are manufactured by Hotei Foods, based in Shizuoka, southwest of Tokyo. The company said they expect their cans will blast off when Japanese astronauts leave for the ISS next year.</p>
<p>They won JAXA approval after clearing a rigorous set of criteria such as guaranteeing the food would not degrade even after 18 months at room temperature.</p>

<p>As temperatures dip into the sub-zeros and the cold winds grow stronger, Beijing begins to enter winter. For a lot of locals during this time of the year, there is nothing better than sitting down for some Sic<br />
<em>hu</em>an hot pot with friends or family to let the blazingly hot spices warm up their bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For people from Guangdong Province in South China, however, this comforting dream would actually be a nightmare as many of them do not like eating spicy food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not some chili peppers should be added to a dish has been a question that Cao Yu and his family constantly wrestled with while he was growing up because his father is from Guangdong, while his mother is from Central China&#8217;s Hunan Province, which is also known for its spicy food. Most of the time, his father relented out of love for his family and everyone ended up eating spicy food. This push and pull among family members, ignited Cao&#8217;s interest in this spicy ingredient, leading him to research how chili peppers were introduced to China and its development in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cao, a researcher from the Center for Migration &amp; Ethnic Studies at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province, began by looking into literature references, followed by extensive field research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After years of work, he was finally able to present his findings in his book<br />
<em>The History of Eating Spicy Food in China</em> in June.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book introduces several interesting tidbits of trivia about chili peppers. For instance, it was Afonso de Albuquerque, a Portuguese general, who introduced chili peppers to Asia in the 15th century. After he arrived in India, he started growing some plants he brought from North America, such as tomatoes, cashews, pineapples and chili peppers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book also touched upon the first time that chili peppers were mentioned in Chinese text. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Gao Lian, a writer from Hangzhou in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, wrote in his collection of various prescriptions for a healthy and long life known as<br />
<em>Zunsheng Bajian</em>, &#8220;The white flowers of<br />
<em><em>fan</em><em>jiao</em></em> (Lit: foreign peppers) grow thick. The fruits look like broken ink brushes. They taste spicy, and their red color is rather pleasant.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, rather than being grown for food, chili pepper plants were mainly ornamental.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the word<br />
<em><em>fan</em><em>jiao</em></em> as a clue, Cao looked to the name of dishes to examine the development of chili peppers in China. In Chinese, the words<br />
<em>hu</em>,<br />
<em>fan</em>,<br />
<em>yang</em> were used for ingredients with exotic origins such as<br />
<em>hu</em><br />
<em>jiao</em> (pepper),<br />
<em>hu</em><br />
<em>luobo</em> (carrot),<br />
<em>fan</em><br />
<em>qie</em> (tomato),<br />
<em>fanshu</em> (sweet potato),<br />
<em>yang</em><br />
<em>cong</em> (onion) and<br />
<em>yang</em><br />
<em>baicai</em> (cabbage). Not always, but under most circumstances,<br />
<em>hu</em> indicates that the food was introduced to China between the Qin Dynasty (221BC-206 BC) and Song Dynasty (960-1279), while<br />
<em>fan</em> is associated with the period between the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). After Qing, foreign food introduced to China mostly used<br />
<em>yang</em>. Another item of interest,<br />
<em>hu</em> indicates that the food was introduced to China over land, while<br />
<em>fan</em> and<br />
<em>yang</em> are linked with food that arrived by a marine route to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cao noted that chili peppers, were primarily introduced to China through coastal regions such as the southern provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang and Taiwan, as well as Liaoning Province in Northeast China.</p>
<p>Before chili peppers became part of Chinese people&#8217;s diet, people first discovered its value as a medicine used to alleviate pain. Then later it entered kitchens as an ingredient for dishes. According to the early 18th century Gazetteer of Sizhou Prefecture, &#8221;<br />
<em>hai</em><br />
<em>jiao</em> [lit. sea pepper] is commonly known as<br />
<em>lahu</em>o [lit. spicy fire], the Tu and Miao [two ethnic groups in China] people use it instead of salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A session on The Paper, a Chinese news website, readers and netizens who haven&#8217;t read the book launched a series of intriguing discussions about consuming spicy food in China with Cao.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The habit and capacity of eating spicy food varies from individual to individual. Interestingly, even in Hunan Province, many people don&#8217;t eat spicy food,&#8221; Cao wrote.&nbsp;</p>
