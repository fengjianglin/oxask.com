<br />US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors monitored the latest development of trade issues between the United States and its major trading partners.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 280.23 points, or 1.01 percent, to 27,502.81. The S&amp;P 500 fell 20.67 points, or 0.66 percent, to 3,093.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 47.34 points, or 0.55 percent, to 8,520.64.</p>
<p>Most of the 30 Dow components traded in red territory, with Intel and Dow declining 2.76 percent and 2.52 percent, respectively, leading the laggards.</p>
<p>Nine of the 11 primary S&amp;P 500 sectors traded on a downbeat note, with the energy sector losing 1.55 percent, the biggest loser.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will &#8220;restore&#8221; tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Brazil and Argentina, drawing wide concern domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>Calling the move &#8220;unexpected,&#8221; Argentine Minister of Production and Labor Dante Sica said &#8220;we still don&#8217;t know what this implies. We want to know the details and the scope of the announcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brazil Steel Institute, which represents the interests of steel exporters, said in a statement that the new tariffs would hurt not only Brazilian companies, but also U.S. steel companies, as they would need the semi-finished products imported from Brazil.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s threat to hit French products with tariffs over a taxation dispute concerning large U.S. tech companies also fueled turmoil in the stock market.</p>

<p>Huawei&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is under the spotlight from Chinese netizens again, but this time for her taste in fashion.</p>
<p>Following the one-year anniversary of Meng&#8217;s arrest in Canada on Sunday, she said in an open letter that she was &#8220;no longer afraid of the unknown&#8221; despite moments of fear and torment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her relaxed and fearless attitude has clearly influenced Chinese internet users. On social media, people have begun to pay attention to things outside of her legal proceedings &#8211; Meng&#8217;s outfits at several court appearances.</p>
<p>Some users on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo said that Meng&#8217;s ensembles when she appears in court are eye-catching and change the stereotypically conservative image of Chinese businesswomen.</p>
<p>Some fashion bloggers have listed her outfits and their corresponding brands from each public appearance.</p>
<p>One look featuring a Max Mara tobacco-colored cashmere coat, and another featuring a black Chanel coat, were compared to similar court outfits worn by former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy when she sued a paparazzo.</p>
<p>In addition to her clothes, Meng&#8217;s shoes were also widely discussed &#8211; her sparkling Jimmy Choos were a particular delight for netizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GPS monitor strapped to her ankle looks like a fashion accessory with her calm attitude and confidence,&#8221; said a fashion blogger.</p>
<p>Some netizens said that her outfits have been praised because they reflect Meng&#8217;s strong, confident spirit and positive energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her confidence and bravery should be admired, as she always holds her head high when making public appearances,&#8221; said a Sina Weibo user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chiang Mai&#8217;s hotel room occupancy is likely to drop to about 60 percent throughout this year, according to a hotelier of Thailand&#8217;s northern tourist province.</p>
<p>La-iad Bungsrithong, chief of the Thai Hotels Association&#8217;s Northern Chapter, said on Monday that the room occupancy in all districts of Chiang Mai is believed to drop to as low as 60 percent throughout this year, compared to 75 percent last year.</p>
<p>The northern tourist province currently has an estimated 60,000 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Some 8.08 million tourists have visited Chiang Mai during this year&#8217;s first 10 months, accounting for a 1.14 percent drop from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chiang Mai&#8217;s decreased occupancy is expected to fairly rebound during the first quarter of 2020, given MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events to be organized for government personnel as well as corporate employees, La-iad said.</p>
<p>The sluggish tourism of Chiang Mai is largely attributed to the strengthened baht, prompting foreign tourists to go elsewhere, she said.</p>

<p>Chief Executive of China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said Tuesday that more relief measures will be rolled out soon to help businesses and residents weather out economic hardship, following three rounds of such policies adopted during the past months.</p>
<p>As multiple data have revealed a grim economic circumstance, the HKSAR government will closely monitor the situation and carry out new relief measures, Lam told a press conference.</p>
<p>The HKSAR government has allocated about 20 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.55 billion U.S. dollars) in total since August in hopes of reviving an economy that has stepped into a technical recession.</p>

<p>GLOOMY ECONOMY</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost millions of Hong Kong dollars each month recently,&#8221; a server of a spicy crab restaurant in Causeway Bay said. At lunchtime, there were only a few diners at the restaurant that just opened in July.</p>
<p>Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said Hong Kong&#8217;s catering sector is expected to lose 17 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.17 billion U.S. dollars) from June and December, and about 400 restaurants have closed down so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;The official unemployment rate in Hong Kong&#8217;s catering industry in October is 6.1 percent, but my estimate is 7 to 7.5 percent, that is nearly 22,000 people lost their jobs in October,&#8221; he said. He was afraid that over 1,000 more restaurants may not survive the current crisis by February.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business sentiment has turned pessimistic, weighed down by external uncertainties and local violent incidents that have dragged on for months,&#8221; HKSAR government Financial Secretary Paul Chan said at a meeting of the Legislative Council, stressing that industries from tourism to catering are struggling in the bleak winter.</p>
<p>Retail sales decreased 24.3 percent from a year ago in October, the largest decline for a single month on record. Visitors to Hong Kong tumbled 43.7 percent year on year in October.</p>
<p>The economy dropped 2.9 percent in the third quarter, sharply down from the 0.4-percent growth in the second quarter.</p>

<p>PESSIMISTIC SENTIMENT</p>
<p>&#8220;Three months? Half a year? I have no idea when my life can be normal again,&#8221; a tour guide surnamed Wan said. The veteran tour guide who had gone through hard days of the financial crisis and the SARS outbreak felt that he could not make it this time.</p>
<p>With no tour groups to receive since June, Wan has started to take part-time jobs at metro stations and restaurants.</p>
<p>Tourism was one of the hardest-hit sectors by the months-long violence. &#8220;There is no sign of a recovery in December, instead a 30-to-40 percent drop in the tourism revenue will be likely,&#8221; a lawmaker and tourism industry insider Yiu Si-wing said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the situation settles down a little bit, the sector is unlikely to return to the previous level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HKSAR government has cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2019 to a negative 1.3 percent, which will be the region&#8217;s first annual decline since 2009. The unemployment rate, which has already spiked to 3.1 percent during the August-October period, will likely rise further in the coming months.</p>
<p>Hong Kong will likely register its first budget deficit in 15 years for the current fiscal year ending on March 31, as the economy has slipped into a technical recession amid the prolonged social unrest, Paul Chan said.</p>
<p>Despite possible fiscal deficits in the coming one or two years, it is high time the HKSAR government made full use of the wealth and surplus accumulated in the past to relieve the burden on residents, Carrie Lam said.</p>

<p>VIOLENCE MUST END</p>
<p>Lam said she hopes violent incidents will stop as soon as possible to give the economy a chance to recover.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that relief measures can only help businesses keep afloat for a longer time and it is the end of violence and the restoring of peace that will allow people to return to their normal lives and push the economy back on track.</p>
<p>Chan also expressed concerns about looming challenges to the economy in the next year and even bigger impacts on people&#8217;s livelihood, as well as the dented confidence of international investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need concerted efforts from all sectors of the community to stop violence and chaos and facilitate the economic recovery,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;So that order can be restored, residents can live a peaceful life again and businesses can operate normally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiple districts in Kowloon descended again into chaos over the weekend as rioters hijacked public events and resorted to destructive acts like building barricades on roads, setting fires and vandalizing public facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />China&#8217;s ride-hailing giant DiDi kicked off operations in 13 more Chilean cities on Tuesday, bringing the total to 23.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s expansion means the service is available from north to south, with five northern cities of Arica, Iquique, Calama, Copiapo and Ovalle and seven southern cities of Curico, Chillan, Los Angeles, Valdivia, Osorno, Coyhaique and Punta Arenas, as well as the central city of Los Andes, now within DiDi&#8217;s sphere of operations.</p>
<p>DiDi&#8217;s ride-sharing and taxi services have been well-received in the South American country, enabling the company&#8217;s rapid expansion, said Simeng Wang, general manager of DiDi Chile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very thankful for the support and reception we have had since the starting in Chile,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, without a doubt, DiDi&#8217;s commitment is to deliver a better service at a more convenient price, so everyone in the country can have access to the advantages of our platform,&#8221; Wang added.</p>
<p>DiDi first entered the Chilean market in June, with 16,000 registered drivers in the resort town of Valparaiso. In August, the company started operating in Santiago.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei logo File photo: IC</p>
<p>Chinese telecom giant Huawei is facing intense fire on Chinese social media after the company reportedly played a role in sending a former employee to be detained for more than 250 days and failed to quell widespread criticism.</p>
<p>The growing criticism of Huawei, which has won broad support from the Chinese public in its fight against the US crackdown over the past year or so, marks a significant shift in public sentiment toward the company and sparks discussion about the country&#8217;s ever-growing tech giants&#8217; treatment of employees.</p>
<p>Huawei grabbed the spotlight again following news reports that Huawei tipped off the authorities, claiming Li Hongyuan, who worked in the company for 12 years and sought 300,000 yuan ($42,511.68) in severance compensation as he left Huawei in 2018, blackmailed the company, which eventually led to Li&#8217;s detention by public security departments in Shenzhen for 251 days, according to media reports. In August, Li was acquitted after the procuratorate in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, where Huawei is headquartered, decided to drop the case because of insufficient evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 25, Li was awarded 100,000 yuan in state compensation for his detention and asked Huawei to repair damages to his reputation. Li has also demanded an apology and a meeting with Huawei executives but received no response from the company.</p>
<p>After growing criticism on social media (the topic of Li&#8217;s demand for an apology from Huawei saw 240 million views on Sina Weibo as of Tuesday night), Huawei on Monday issued a statement, which not only failed to dispel criticism but sparked a new wave of outrage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei has the right and also the obligation to report suspected illegal conducts to the judicial authorities based on facts,&#8221; reads the statement. &#8220;If Li Hongyuan thinks his rights and interests have been damaged, we support him to take legal weapons to protect them, including suing Huawei.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li said that the statement from Huawei was hardly comforting.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m going home now… freedom is now more important than anything,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Tuesday&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that Huawei has not reached Li or his family directly on the matter but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>On Chinese social media the reactions to Huawei&#8217;s statement was furious, with some calling Huawei unapologetic and arrogant. Others argued that Huawei can treat the case based entirely on laws but it lacks human compassion.</p>
<p>But there is also no shortage of support for Huawei, with some arguing that Huawei did what it had to do to protect its own interests by using legal means and should not bow to public opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Huawei bowed to public opinion and apologized, it would send a signal to others that they can also start trouble [for Huawei] to gain more interests. If that happens, thousands leave Huawei each year, can it still operate normally?&#8221; Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, wrote in an article on Tuesday. &#8220;If it takes actions in accordance with the law, then it should be bold and straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s case came just days after a similar case involving another Chinese telecom firm NetEase, which also faced heavy criticism after an employee claimed that he got fired after he was terminally ill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, the employee said in a statement reported by several media outlets that he had settled the dispute with the company, which sincerely apologized and offered full support in his treatment.</p>
<p>The back-to-back cases also renewed heated discussion over working conditions at Chinese tech companies, with some questioning the tech world&#8217;s so-called &#8220;996&#8221; work hour system, where employees work from 9 am to 9 pm and six days a week.</p>
<p>While some criticized the work schedule, others expressed understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the US enacted two laws that could be potentially punishing for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy, there is no clear sign that its close allies &#8211; including the UK, Canada, Germany and Australia &#8211; will follow suit immediately, despite rising calls for them to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these countries, the decision presents a huge dilemma as they consider their massive economic interests in the global finance and commerce hub and the potentially damaging countermeasures any such attempt could prompt from Beijing, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a fact that these Western countries cannot ignore: &#8220;Sanctioning Hong Kong is looking for trouble,&#8221; Liang Haiming, a Hong Kong-based economist, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Take the EU as an example. Hong Kong was the bloc&#8217;s 20th largest trading partner in 2018 and its eighth-largest partner in Asia, with a total trade volume reaching 46.5 billion euros ($51.5 billion), according to EU data. Additionally, the EU has over 2,200 companies operating in the city.</p>
<p>Germany, Australia and Canada also have huge economic interests in Hong Kong, which serves as a hub for trade in and out of the Chinese mainland. In 2018, trade between Hong Kong and Germany reached 14.12 billion euros, while trade between Hong Kong and Australia stood at $6.9 billion, according to official Hong Kong data. Trade between Canada and Hong Kong reached $3.76 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>Though officials in Germany, the UK, Australia and Canada have long sided with the radical protesters in Hong Kong, thus far they have not publicly announced any concrete actions to follow the US&#8217; suit, despite rising domestic calls for them to do so.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, Foreign Office ministers have threatened to use sanctions laws against individuals in Hong Kong that they deem guilty of human rights abuses, the Guardian reported on November 13. In Canada, there are also calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to adopt US-style laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything, these countries &#8220;should be chastising the US for hurting their interests,&#8221; Liang said, noting that the US move is &#8220;an unjust cause that lacks popular support.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the two new US laws requires the US government, specifically the US State Department, to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong&#8217;s human rights and democracy status, which could then lead to a change in its special trade arrangement with the US. The move has drawn fury from officials in Beijing, who called it blatant interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs and a punishment for Hong Kong&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>China on Monday announced countermeasures against the US&#8217; move, including the suspension of US warship and aircraft visits to the city and the sanctioning of multiple US-based non-governmental organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its allies follow in the US&#8217; footsteps, they will &#8220;also face the ire of China&#8217;s central government,&#8221; Liang said.</p>

<p>China on Tuesday extended praise to several European countries for ramping up efforts to establish a barter mechanism that is designed to circumvent the US&#8217; unilateral sanctions on Iran, billing the move as conducive to break US financial hegemony.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry also expressed hope that the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a European initiative to facilitate non-dollar transactions with Iran, will include more countries beyond the EU.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome the decision of the six European countries and support continuous progress of the INSTEX,&#8221; Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, told a briefing on Tuesday, referring to the six European countries that have so far jumped on board on the initiative.</p>
<p>On Monday, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway announced that they would join France, Germany and the UK in the INSTEX, boosting the status of the mechanism and dealing a blow to the US, which unilaterally withdrew from an agreement reached by major countries, including China, and reinstated sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>Hua said that the EU&#8217;s move is an effort to safeguard the Iran nuclear agreement, support multilateralism and preserve a rules-based global order. This is conducive to breaking the US&#8217; financial hegemony, Hua said.</p>
<p>As the US continues to crack down on Chinese companies based on its domestic laws and sanctions, China has been pushing for alternatives to the current US dollar-dominated global clearing system for transactions, including setting up non-dollar settlement systems with trading partners.</p>
<p>On November 19, China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding to boost the use of the yuan and the ruble in bilateral and international trade. Facing US sanctions, Venezuela has also offered to pay suppliers and contractors in yuan for oil transactions, Reuters reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a clear sign of China&#8217;s interest in the INSTEX, the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China was expecting that the &#8220;mechanism will soon be expanded to have more operational scope and be open to third-party countries.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Macao Special Administrative Region is set to re-anchor its economy to the financial sector as the casino capital of the world eyes closer ties with the Chinese mainland to rev up its economic diversification away from the gambling industry, a veteran market watcher said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city, scheduled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland later this month, is embracing new opportunities to diversify its economy toward the financial sector, Ding Meng, a senior strategist at Bank of China&#8217;s Macao branch, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two areas of focus for the central government to consider when it comes to policies to boost the role of the financial sector in Macao&#8217;s economy, Ding said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, mainland companies can be encouraged to issue bonds in Macao with the government offering interest subsidies and simplifying issuance procedures, he suggested, noting that unlike Hong Kong, the banking sector in Macao is composed mostly of mainland banks, meaning the risks could be easily controlled.</p>
<p>For another, Hengqin, a free trade zone in Zhuhai, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province can be tapped to spur the financial sector in Macao. Hengqin, increasingly a magnet for financial businesses, is an ideal location for domestic businesses to set up fund pools and fundraising hubs, thereby benefiting the adjacent city of Macao, he went on to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s flagging gambling sector, still a hefty contributor to local finances, apparently puts the local economy under pressure to pursue green shoots of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s gross gaming revenue shrank 8.5 percent year-on-year in November, worsening from a contraction of 3.2 percent in the prior month, according to data from the city&#8217;s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.</p>
<p>In the first 11 months of the year, the city&#8217;s gross gaming revenue fell 2.4 percent on a yearly basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s economy contracted 4.5 percent year-on-year in real terms in the third quarter, official data showed. This marked the third consecutive quarterly contraction. In the first nine months, the local economy fell by 3.5 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The financial sector is an important part of Macao&#8217;s economy, albeit trailing the gambling and property sectors in terms of contribution to GDP, which offers a viable alternative to underpin the city&#8217;s economic growth, according to Ding.</p>
<p>He cited the city&#8217;s legal environment, its alignment with the international markets, its offshore market, and Macao&#8217;s proximity to Hong Kong, one of the global key financial hubs.</p>
