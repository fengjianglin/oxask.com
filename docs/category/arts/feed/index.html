<p>&nbsp;Amid the 80th anniversary of Marvel Comics, a video showing stories of Chinese Marvel fans is circulating on Chinese social media, in which fans talk about the Marvel world as a kind of utopia that can stimulate them to overcome difficulties in real life.</p>
<p>Since 1939, when Marvel was started by Martin Goodman, the comics have spread around the world and 23 films based on Marvel characters have grossed over $22.5 billion at the global box office. Although the comics brand has a long history, it is still young in China, one of the Chinese fans said in the video.</p>
<p>The video shows three Chinese Marvel fans who have different ages and professions but have the same deep love for Marvel.</p>
<p>He Jia, a designer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) who was born in the 1970s, came across Iron Man 11 years ago. He said he was inspired by the symbolic gestures of the hero and he even designed the UAVs belonging to Iron Man that appear in the movies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I researched UAVs, I often entered the world of the comics and imagined myself as Iron Man,&#8221; He said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell that I am more than 40 years old from appearance. Marvel brings young blood to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu Yuze and Hu Tianqi are cover painters for Marvel comics who were born in the 1990s and 2000s. The younger fans have the same feelings as He. &#8220;When you paint these characters, you will feel their mind. I can enter the Marvel world rather than letting characters step out,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>But this does not mean they want to hide in the Marvel universe to avoid difficulties in real life. &#8220;Marvel shows many super heroes to us and although it does not ask us to become one of them, it encourages us to become braver and better ourselves,&#8221; Wu said.</p>
<p>C. B. Cebulski, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, said in July that China has also been brought into the Marvel Universe, according to a report by Xinhua News Agency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />60-year-old Zhang Jinlai, the classic Monkey King for lots of Chinese people, announced on Monday that he will reenact the movie version of Monkey King.</p>
<p>Better known by his stage name Liu Xiao Ling Tong, Zhang&#8217;s announcement of his return to the big screen got some Chinese netizens excited, but also sparked some opposition on social media.</p>
<p>Zhang played the role of Monkey King in the 1986 classic TV series Journey to the West and its later 2000 sequel, which have been recounted in the memories of Chinese netizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;My happiest time of the day was when I sat in front of the TV and watched Journey to the West with my parents after dinner,&#8221; commented one netizen on Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>The new movie, also called Journey to the West, is directed by Han Yan, director of Animal World, and will use the technology of motion capture to finish the Monkey King&#8217;s filming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monkey King is the earliest hero in my mind and I grew up with him,&#8221; Han said when asked on social media why he shot the film about the mythological figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Liu Xiao Ling Tong deserves the title of Monkey King,&#8221; wrote another netizen.</p>
<p>Many netizens said that they will support the movie when it is released to &#8220;pay tribute to this classic from their younger years.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, some netizens worried that Zhang is unfit for high-intensity filming at his age. &#8220;He should take care of his health,&#8221; a Sina Weibo user commented.</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s compelling performance in Journey to the West was greatly praised by critics and helped him win the Best Actor award at the sixth Golden Eagle Awards in 1988.</p>

<p>A Manchu language&nbsp;inheritor said on Tuesday that only about 200 to 300 people in China are able to speak the critically endangered language.</p>
<p>Tan Shanshan, a 33-year-old language inheritor whose ancestor belongs to the Plain White Banner, one of the eight banners of Manchu military and society, has opened online and offline Manchu classes in Ningguta, Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province, to try to save the endangered language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoken by the Manchu, one of China&#8217;s ethnic minority groups, the language originated from the region between China and the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>. It was one of the official languages of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and was spoken among the people in court and bureaucracy as a symbol of their advanced hierarchy. However, after the end of the Qing Dynasty, the prominence of the Manchu language declined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are nearly 10 million Manchus in China, most of which living in provinces in Northeast China, a large majority speak Putonghua (Standard Chinese). According to UNESCO&#8217;s Atlas of the World&#8217;s Languages in Danger in 2016, only 20 people in the world still spoke Manchu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My passion for Manchu is not only to learn the language well, but also to get more people speaking and writing in Manchu. I do not want it to exit the world forever,&#8221; Tan said in an interview with Chinese media outlet Pear Video on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The hashtag for the classes earned 160 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Tuesday, with many Chinese netizens saying they support the conservation of China&#8217;s ethnic minority languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel ashamed when someone asks me if I can speak Manchu. I hope one day I can speak it fluently,&#8221; one ethnic Manchu student who asked to remain anonymous told Pear Video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a good idea to open Manchu language classes because people who are interest in the culture might learn more when they master the language,&#8221; Zhou Wei, a teacher at Tianjin Foreign Studies Universities who is Manchu on her mother&#8217;s side, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Zhou also pointed that Manchu language learning tends to be more research-oriented since only a few people can speak it and it is difficult to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the report from news outlet china.com.cn, the Manchu alphabet is based on the Mongolian alphabet and is written from top to bottom. Manchu letters are written vertically from top to bottom with columns going from left to right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally think the language&#8217;s research value is much higher than its usage value. We need to record the language system including the pronunciation of words, grammar and some special usages. But if we take it as a kind of cultural renaissance, that would be a useless effort,&#8221; Zhou said.</p>

<p>The World Heritage application for the Tea Horse Road by China, Mongolia and Russia, will serve as an example for international cooperation, according to Sergey Kalashnikov, chairman of the Russia International Cooperation Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cooperation among China, Mongolia and Russia on this application process will not only promote the cultural and economic development of the countries, provinces, cities and counties along the ancient Tea Horse Road but also provide new perspectives for international cooperation on culture, technology and trade, Sergey said.</p>
<p>Sergey made the remarks at a forum on the application process which was held in the city of Wuyishan in East China&#8217;s Fujian Province on Sunday. Attendees of the forum include scholars from China, Mongolia and Russia, as well as representatives from cities along the road.</p>
<p>The ancient Tea Horse Road, which dates back to the 17th century, was a network of ancient trade routes that came into being after the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>. It passed through Chinese provinces including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei and Shanxi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and extended to Mongolia and Russia.</p>
<p>The ancient Tea Horse Road was inscribed on the &#8220;World Heritage Tentative List in China&#8221; in March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cantonese crosstalk, a branch of the Chinese traditional comedic performance in the form of a dialogue, was offered 2.6 million yuan ($369,801) as initial funding for a foundation to stop the art form from disappearing.</p>
<p>Cantonese crosstalk developed from the crosstalk of northern China that was based on Putonghua in the 1950s. After nearly 70 years of development, &#8220;Cantonese crosstalk is an indispensable folk art in the Guangfu region, a Cantonese-speaking region containing Guangzhou, capital of South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao,&#8221; according to a document sent to the Global Times by the Chinese Cultural Promotion Society of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Based on the traditional art forms of speaking, learning and teasing as well as singing in northern China&#8217;s crosstalk, Cantonese crosstalk integrates the cultural elements of the Guangfu region and the characteristics of the Cantonese language. The contents of the performance are more in line with the interests and tastes of people living in the region.</p>
<p>As more art forms and different languages are introduced in the region, Cantonese crosstalk has become less popular and less well-known among the younger generations, and there is even a risk of it disappearing. &#8220;Cantonese crosstalk has entered the stage of talent shortage and lack of creation,&#8221; Wu Xiaoxi, chief executive officer of the promotion society, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>There are less than 20 Cantonese crosstalk performers in Guangdong Province now, according to a report by China News Service.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, a special fund was launched on Saturday in Guangzhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wu said that the fund will be used to seek and train new talent. &#8220;We will go to kindergartens and schools to carry out the language art training of Cantonese among the young generations, and we will hold crosstalk contests in Cantonese regularly,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As well as these measures, there are plans to edit and print textbooks about crosstalk, which will also need funding.</p>
<p>The initial fund of 2.6 million yuan has already been prepared and the promotion society has received donations from many crosstalk fans. The use of the funding will be managed and supervised by the promotion society.</p>
<p>The fund is one of various measures to protect and develop the folk art. An educational team for Cantonese crosstalk is being established, organized by professional performers who want to popularize the traditional artform.</p>

<p>US microblogging and social networking website Tumblr just released its 2019 review report on the K-pop industry. Boy band BTS topped the chart for &#8220;most talked-about&#8221; idol group, while its seven members claimed the first seven spots on the K-pop stars chart, starting with Jeon Jung-kook at No.1 for his second year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the third time that BTS has topped the Tumblr charts. The site generates the results through its &#8220;Fandometrics&#8221; calculations, which compiles tag data and posts about K-pop stars and groups on its website to understand how much they are talked about.</p>
<p>The news of BTS&#8217;s feat quickly spread to China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Members of the Chinese ARMY (the name for BTS fans) took to social media to express their excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;That is BTS! Every member is on the chart!&#8221; wrote netizen Youyu on Sina Weibo.</p>
