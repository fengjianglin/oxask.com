<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit South Korea on Wednesday and Thursday for the first time in five years as the two countries seek to improve ties amid a spat over the installation of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1012594.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD</a>) anti-missile system in South Korea. What is the significance of the visit? What are the stumbling blocks in China-South Korea relations and how to get rid of them? Global Times reporter Yu Jincui talked to two scholars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheng Xiaohe, associate professor with the School of International Studies, Renmin University of China; a senior researcher with the Pangoal Institute</p>
<p>China-South Korea relations are in a transitional period. The ice is melting between the two countries but spring has not yet arrived. The toughest time for bilateral relations has passed, but some problems caused by the deployment of the THAAD system in South Korea remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An urgent task for the two countries is to solve the problems left over by the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1038658.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD deployment</a> while at the same time preventing bilateral ties from being affected by new issues. For instance, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US wants to deploy an intermediate range conventional missile in Asia after the US withdrew from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. There were reports that South Korea has been singled out as a place for the deployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether South Korea hosts the US intermediate-range missile is a potential challenge for China-South Korea relations. Rounds of negotiations between the US and South Korea on sharing the cost of maintaining US troops on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a> have ended without an agreement. The US has piled pressure on South Korea, if the latter doesn&#8217;t compromise over the cost-sharing issue, it might make concessions over other issues such as allowing the US to deploy the intermediate-range missile on its soil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as South Korea has already suffered a lot because of the deployment of THAAD, it would deal with the intermediate-range missile deployment issue very prudently. In the foreseeable future, I believe the chance that it allows the US missile deployment is very slim. One important reason is that once it agrees, it is going to completely ruin China-South Korea relations and have unbearable consequences for Seoul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li Jiacheng, research fellow at the Research Center for the Economies and Politics of Transitional Countries, Liaoning University&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s visit indicates that China-South Korea relations are recovering. It sends out a signal that bilateral ties are going back on track and will continue to move forward. South Korea expects President Xi Jinping to visit Seoul next year and hopes bilateral relations battered by the THAAD row could become normal after Xi&#8217;s visit. Therefore, whether the two countries could pave the way for Xi&#8217;s visit would be on the agenda of Wang&#8217;s two-day trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that Seoul would agree to Washington&#8217;s deployment of intermediate-range conventional missiles on its soil. Compared to THAAD, such missiles are offensive weapons, which will cause greater harm to China&#8217;s strategic security. There is no doubt that China would take stronger countermeasures once South Korea allows the US to deploy the missiles. This is not what South Korea wants to see. Seoul is unwilling to upset the thaw in China-South Korea relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s visit comes amid a simmering row between Japan and South Korea. Japan-South Korea conflicts are still controllable as Seoul has reversed its decision not to renew the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), but further follow up is needed to alleviate tensions. The China-Japan-South Korea trilateral summit is to be held in China this month. China could play a mediating role between South Korea and Japan so as to prevent bilateral conflicts jeopardizing trilateral cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, December is a critical month. In April, it was reported by<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>n media that North Korean leader<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//daily-specials/Where-is-Kim-Jong-un/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un</a> said in a speech he would wait until the end of this year for the US to change its approach to denuclearization talks. It&#8217;s possible Kim would take adventurous steps after the year-end limit, bringing new uncertainties to the Korean Peninsula issue. It&#8217;s particularly important for China and South Korea to conduct strategic communications at this juncture to try to keep North Korea willing to talk to the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg entered the US presidential race last week. The billionaire&#8217;s quest for the White House began with an ad funded by his $31 billion campaign corpus. At a time social media is playing an integral role in US politics, Bloomberg&#8217;s use of television demonstrates how wealth is still the horse that powers the mass media cart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presidential candidates with the strongest grasp of media have shaped the political landscape for some time. In 2007, a junior US senator from Illinois managed to market hope and change to a cynical electorate. Directing campaign staff to spearhead outreach online and offline, then-senator Barack Obama was adept at using the tools of 21st century new media. With backing from Goldman Sachs, it wasn&#8217;t long before the neoliberal politician was able to clinch the Democratic nomination. Obama knew where to focus when selling a political platform in the age of Facebook and Twitter. The &#8220;Yes We Can&#8221; music video propelled the Obama phenomenon.</p>
<p>Distinguishing himself as a candidate against Wall Street recklessness and a critic of &#8220;mind-set that got us into the [Iraq] War,&#8221; his campaign was bolstered when John McCain, then presidential candidate for the Republican Party, picked then Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his vice president. Palin was widely seen as an incompetent candidate after an interview where she seemed unfamiliar with the names of major media outlets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite starting another war in Libya and having an administration made up of career politicians from the Bush and Clinton dynasties, Obama was able to retain the aura of political change when he beat his Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012. Lackluster debate performances lowered his 2012 election margins over Romney, but his campaign&#8217;s mass marketing expertise delivered another four years of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, enter Bloomberg. The unprecedented digitalization of the political landscape has been naturally used to empower the US most privileged sector &#8211; billionaires.</p>
<p>In the 2016 election, US President Donald Trump&#8217;s Twitter account propelled his rise as defined by a Republican primary with over a dozen opponents the media deemed more credible and qualified. Despite losing the popular vote to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Trump could garner about 63 million votes and win the electoral college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s rise was helped by the free airtime he received from news commentators of major cable networks who consistently covered his campaign and its appeal to white nationalists. His tweets then, as they do now, disseminated right-wing fanaticism. Mainstream commentators nonetheless widely publicized them. They emphasized the nature of his viral performance, calling it &#8220;unpresidential,&#8221; instead of spending time accurately covering the proposed policies of other candidates.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s far-right, xenophobic sentiments were acknowledged, but only in the context of the way he communicated them. Racism in past presidential campaigns, such as George H.W. Bush&#8217;s Willie Horton ad or Richard Nixon&#8217;s use of the Southern Strategy, was more discreet. US history shows past presidents, including many Democrats, have implemented many of Trump&#8217;s policies. The difference was that in 2016, a country changed by social media finally had a sobering look at itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this climate, Bloomberg&#8217;s use of traditional media may swing the pendulum away from online platforms. It is certain that Bloomberg, a media mogul, will keep his informational arsenal. Bloomberg News sent a memo to its 2,700 employees telling them not to investigate the former mayor&#8217;s campaign. The network&#8217;s coverage will steer clear of covering Democratic rivals, but focus on Trump, keeping with the practice of mainstream media holding the president&#8217;s spectacle in the spotlight. Spin will play a focal part in Bloomberg&#8217;s media spectacle regardless of how the media he doesn&#8217;t own spin his campaign.</p>
<p>The rest of the media, just like Bloomberg News, will likely ignore the substance of Bloomberg&#8217;s agenda or his record of controversial policies such as the racist stop-and-frisk practice and his support for the Iraq War. Corporate social media will especially generate stories on Bloomberg&#8217;s character as removed from his career. Their algorithms are made for creating a spectacle, and are not meant for principled policy discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social media has taken presidential politics by storm. Facebook has collaborated with Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg&#8217;s campaign while traditional mainstream media outlets openly attack candidates like Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Senator Bernie Sanders for rejecting the Washington Consensus. Sanders has accumulated the most individual donors of any candidate in the Democratic primary but struggles to gain the social media coverage of a front runner. Bloomberg&#8217;s international recognition that arguably predates Sanders&#8217; will likely contribute to that trend. For<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/967085.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/US-election-2016/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US election</a>s, grassroots appeal and a commitment to social justice don&#8217;t determine whether a candidate can clinch the attention of a major newsroom. In the Trump era, building on decades of media deregulation and centuries of political disenfranchisement, Bloomberg&#8217;s candidacy showcases how social media and traditional media work together in the interests of their owners.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, in December 2018, was a turning point in China-Canada relations, which plummeted after the arrest. The time-consuming case touches the nerve of Chinese and Canadian people, and the political fraternity in both countries. The longer the standoff lasts, the harder it will be for relations to be restored to normalcy.</p>
<p>After US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, some Canadian senators followed up by hoping &#8220;the Conservatives will be able to team up with other parties to hold Commons hearings on Hong Kong.&#8221; They wished to make a Canadian version of the US Hong Kong bill and &#8220;enact Magnitsky-style sanctions&#8221; against Chinese mainland and Hong Kong officials responsible for so-called human rights violations.</p>
<p>This shows how Canada&#8217;s lawmakers lack independence when dealing with China-related topics, as they blindly follow the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its attempt to copy the US, Canada has repeatedly made bad calls in trying to bring a thaw in relations with China, despite the fact that tensions with China do not augur well for Canada&#8217;s economic development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though both the Conservative Party and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal Party have shown tough stances toward China, and some Conservatives have attacked Trudeau for being soft on the Asian power, the mainstream attitude toward China within the two parties in the country may not be what media have presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trudeau once said he was unaware of plans to arrest Meng. Obviously he lied. Reports indicated that members of Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal Party had tried to persuade him not to take over the hot potato, but he declined and stubbornly chose to stand with the US in this case. As a result, policies toward China took a beating during his first tenure and are a big reason for him to lose support in the election campaign for the second term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conservative Party said it would be tougher on China, but if it wins power, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily do what it said. In this context, Conservatives&#8217; accusation against Trudeau is more like a strategy to achieve their own political goals by creating trouble for the prime minister over China-related issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both parties&#8217; tough stances on China are actually aimed at getting themselves closer to the US to reap political benefits.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has given the US an opportunity to crack down on Huawei and to contain China, but US pernicious propaganda against China has gradually lost its effect. Some important allies of the US, including Germany, have shown a different attitude toward Huawei. Canada won&#8217;t soon change its attitude toward the Chinese tech company as it follows the US too closely, but it will have to make a choice as the first phase of Meng&#8217;s extradition proceedings is set to begin in January 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the backdrop, it is important for us to continue positive publicity about China and Huawei to counter the effect of lies spread by anti-China politicians from the US and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, we should expand trade connections with Canada, and use trade, people-to-people contacts as well as educational interactions to promote China&#8217;s real image among Canadians. After laying such a foundation of public opinion, the two countries can be persuaded to meet each other halfway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of Meng&#8217;s case, Canada was drawn into the vortex of US-launched trade war against China, and had its economy affected. Hence, bringing China-Canada ties back on track is important for Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast to what Trudeau said that he had &#8220;spent the last four years making things better&#8221; citing increased job creation and lowest unemployment rates in the country&#8217;s history, only 22 percent of Canadians showed strong confidence in his ability to create conditions for economic prosperity, BNN Bloomberg reported, citing a poll by Nanos Research Groups for Bloomberg News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China would be a good way for Trudeau to bring economic prosperity to Canadians as the two countries are highly interdependent in trade with vast potential in trade exchanges. This is what Canadian politicians cannot overlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faced with lack of public trust and dissenting voices from within his Liberal Party and the opposition, Trudeau will have to figure out how to gain more support and govern better in his second term. As China-US trade tensions are slowly mitigating, putting China-Canada ties back on track will not only be a good choice for Trudeau but also be beneficial for his country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opposition attempts to use Hong Kong issue to sow discord in Canadian society but it won&#8217;t affect the big trend of how Canadian government should handle its relations with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese government has shown sincerity and goodwill in terms of Meng&#8217;s case, and Chinese people are looking forward to Canada&#8217;s wise decisions. China and Canada are interdependent in trade, and the two countries should jointly promote globalization to realize win-win cooperation that is in line with their common interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a routine press conference on Monday that &#8220;the Chinese government decides to suspend reviewing requests of US military vessels and aircraft to visit Hong Kong&#8221; starting from Monday, and &#8220;to impose sanctions on NGOs that played an egregious role in the recent disturbance related to an amendment bill in Hong Kong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement came after US President Donald Trump signed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on November 27. The act interferes in China&#8217;s internal affairs and violates international law and the basic principles of foreign relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the first time China has imposed sanctions on multiple organizations because of their interference in the country&#8217;s domestic affairs. It is by far China&#8217;s most powerful countermeasure against foreign forces on the Hong Kong issue. Although Beijing has not announced specific sanctions, the country has backup plans. The sanctions may be just the beginning and send two signals.</p>
<p>First, by imposing sanctions on NGOs, China has sent a strong warning to other organizations which attempt to interfere in Hong Kong. Second, China has made it clear that it will take real steps, and Washington should not underestimate Beijing&#8217;s resolve to safeguard its national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China had refused to allow US warships to dock in Hong Kong in August. By suspending review of the request by US military vessels and aircraft this time, China has underscored its determination &#8211; If the US does not take China&#8217;s stance seriously, the two countries&#8217; engagements in other fields will be affected. China is telling the US that no country can interfere in China&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>The NGOs slapped with sanctions include the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China has not announced how these NGOs will be sanctioned specifically, it is likely these organizations will be banned from getting involved in any activities in China. The visa applications of the staff of these NGOs may also be rejected. Chinese NGOs and individuals who cooperate with these organizations may be sanctioned. China may also completely cut off any financial transactions of these NGOs in the country, including in Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s sanctions are timely. They repudiate brutal US interference and make relevant US organizations and individuals understand the consequences of interfering in China&#8217;s internal affairs. The sanctions can crush US arrogance.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Hong Kong is concerned, the sanctions are not only a proactive move to stop external interference, but will also have a deterrent effect on the violence by radical rioters. If the rioters continue to create chaos in Hong Kong, the central government will launch tougher measures.</p>
<p>If the US continues to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, China can legislate for its countermeasures in the future. For example, China can draw up a law that opposes any foreign intervention in China&#8217;s internal affairs and punishes the organizations and individuals that stir up troubles in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, China can also keep expanding the sanctions list and add more organizations and individuals, including US senators who are extremely anti-China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Trump administration carries out the provisions of the act, China can impose sanctions on senior US government officials who are in charge of related issues, and delay or cancel the two countries&#8217; dialogues in other areas.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa arrived in India on Thursday, in his first foreign visit after taking office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with Strategic News International on November 26, Rajapaksa said that Sri Lanka will not do anything that will harm India&#8217;s security interests, and the country hopes to remain neutral in matters involving international powers. He also said he would request China to renegotiate the Hambantota Port, which the Sri Lankan government leased to a Chinese company for 99 years, adding that the agreement was &#8220;a mistake.&#8221; India and the US have always pointed an accusing finger at the 99-year lease.</p>
<p>Rajapaksa&#8217;s recent statement may be his strategy to make it look that he is not as pro-China as media have described, to ease India&#8217;s geopolitical concerns. He may also need to show his disapproval of Sri Lanka&#8217;s former government&#8217;s policies. Besides, it is possible that Rajapaksa was only making a statement on the specific agreement and hoping to negotiate with China for an adjustment. Generally, China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperation is reciprocal, and the two countries can negotiate the specific projects on the basis of legal contracts and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and Sri Lanka share traditional friendship and their relations have overcome the test of time. In recent years, the two countries have worked together on development strategies and deepened cooperation under the framework of the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI), bringing benefits to the people of the two countries. Rajapaksa has long been pragmatic and friendly toward China. He used to visit China in 2009 as secretary of the country&#8217;s ministry of defense during the administration of his elder brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, to promote China-Sri Lanka relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some Western media outlets have been hyping up China&#8217;s presence in Sri Lanka. They say India regards China as a threat because the latter wants to gain strategic foothold in Sri Lanka &#8211; India&#8217;s so-called backyard.</p>
<p>Such rhetoric reflects the crooked mind-set of some Western media outlets. China&#8217;s assistance to Sri Lanka does not have any political conditions attached. It serves and benefits Sri Lanka&#8217;s entire population. Sri Lanka has responded many times to the so-called China debt trap diplomacy. For example, Mahinda Rajapaksa released a statement in January 2018, saying that &#8220;there was never any Chinese debt trap as alleged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka is located at a crucial point in the Indo-Pacific region, and regarded by the US as a valued friend. In fact, Washington regards all South Asian countries an essential part of its Indo-Pacific Strategy. In the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, published by the US Department of Defense on June 1, the US stated clearly that it &#8220;seeks opportunities to broaden and strengthen partnerships&#8221; with Sri Lanka and several other South Asian countries &#8220;to respond to shared regional challenges.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 4, the US Department of State released a report titled &#8220;A Free and Open Indo-Pacific: Advancing a Shared Vision,&#8221; saying the US is helping Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Maldives &#8220;equip and train their navies and coast guards to safeguard strategic sea lines of communication.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>China does not object to the development of cooperative relations between the US and other countries. However, some US steps in the guise of a response to the so-called China threat theory aim at affecting China&#8217;s overseas security interests and interfering in the BRI. China is firmly opposed to such moves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has an important strategic position in the Indian Ocean, and its significance is increasingly valued by major countries. It will be the new government&#8217;s strategic choice to strike a diplomatic balance and avoid being involved in the conflicts between great powers. Meanwhile, in the long run, people of Sri Lanka will find out which country is sincere in bringing them benefits, and which country wants to interfere in Sri Lanka&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Chinese mobile phone users have been required to submit their facial recognition scans to verify their identity when applying for new phone numbers, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a>. The new rule took effect on Sunday, and triggered much attention from the international community. Many Western media accused the rule of violating human rights, and some even said that China has taken another step toward a &#8220;dystopian surveillance state.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is the most important human right? It might be security. Facial recognition and the real-name system are currently the most effective ways to crack down on telecommunications fraud and identity theft. These measures have successfully protected the personal and property security of Chinese mobile phone users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has become one of the countries with the fastest development of facial recognition, but some Western media have been using the cliché of human rights to attack China. They have not realized that the convenience and security brought by the new technology are also a guarantee of human rights.</p>
<p>For example, some people have blackened China&#8217;s use of surveillance products including facial recognition and big data analysis in Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, saying they violate the human rights of the people in the region. However, these products are meant to detect terrorists and protect ordinary people, and facial recognition has played an important role in countering terrorism and bringing peace back to Xinjiang. Isn&#8217;t this a great explanation of human rights?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, China is not the only country that uses facial recognition and surveillance cameras. These have been adopted by many countries to maintain social security and stability. In October, France reportedly used facial recognition to give its citizens digital identities. As early as 2011, there had already been a network of almost 2 million surveillance cameras in the UK, according to The Guardian&#8217;s report. But why do some Western media hype only China&#8217;s use of facial recognition and surveillance cameras? The Western double standards are way too obvious.</p>
<p>We need to admit that facial recognition has faced some technological controversies. For example, some argue that facial recognition will leak personal information and affect the security of people&#8217;s biological information. It is true that any identification technology should regard users&#8217; rights as a priority.</p>
<p>However, China has been constantly regulating the use of facial recognition.</p>
<p>In November, China set up a national-level working group to set standards for the country&#8217;s first facial recognition regulation. The group consists of 27 prominent Chinese companies, including Tencent and iFlytek, and aims to promote China&#8217;s governance in artificial intelligence and boost the sound development of the industry.</p>
<p>The development of new technology is unstoppable. Instead of accusing China of putting so-called electronic anklets on Chinese people, Western media should see that China has been exploring the boundaries of the rules of new technology. Such exploration can also be a reference for other countries. Some Western countries should not ignore or even blacken China&#8217;s efforts.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will restore tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina. On the same day, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) announced punitive duties on $2.4 billion of imports from France as the country&#8217;s digital services tax &#8220;unfairly targets US companies.&#8221; The USTR also said similar investigations could be conducted against Italy, Turkey and Austria.</p>
<p>The US is losing control by once again swiping the world with tariffs as a weapon and declaring war against the whole world without scruples. This shows that our world is in chaos and the fragile world governance system is basically paralyzed. Something like the law of the jungle that was once abandoned is coming back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday that the US tariffs threats on French goods are &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; But they are nothing against overwhelming US moves. French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> has called for an independent Europe, which differs from Washington&#8217;s ideas. It is not surprising even if the tariffs are a US warning to France.</p>
<p>What kind of era are we living in? Perhaps the answer will come after years.</p>
<p>On one hand, technology is pushing a globalization trend which appears irreversible. But on the other hand, narrow nationalism and populism are experiencing an ill-timed surge. Universal education of all mankind has been achieved quite well, but oversimplified mind-sets and provocative extreme slogans are prevailing.</p>
<p>The criteria of right and wrong are intricately intertwined with the benefits pattern. Public opinion has been used as a weapon, and stirring up emotions can often overwhelm sobering truths or common sense on both the community and world level, making it tougher to separate truth from falsehood.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the US has been exploiting its strength to force the international order to first serve its own national interests. Many countries have fallen victim and have been resisting the US to varying degrees. The actual situation is that the US can hardly bring the whole world under its dominion, but it is also difficult for other countries to revolt. The world is in such a dilemma.</p>
<p>Facing US nonsense and other countries&#8217; anger, Chinese society must do the following things well.</p>
<p>First, China should in no way mistakenly believe that the patience of all countries will run out, and an &#8220;anti-US wave&#8221; will rage like a storm. This is not the basic political logic of today&#8217;s world. In the face of US power, most countries will protect themselves first, and cutting losses by all means will be their actual response.</p>
<p>Second, such a period may last some time. Even if there are political changes inside the US, the world cannot go back to the way it used to be. It is hard to predict what the world will be like.</p>
<p>Third, China is the main target of US suppression, and this won&#8217;t change. We shouldn&#8217;t go all out and collide head-on with the US. It can only contain China in limited areas, which cannot affect China&#8217;s rise. As long as we hold our ground, most US provocations are beating the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China should focus on development and exploring more common interests and values with other countries. US policies toward China are irrational in many aspects with ugly double standards. As long as China better develops and sincerely opens up, we will be capable of dealing with the US while we increasingly receive the support of the international community. These two goals are what we should strive to gradually achieve.</p>

<p>The China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline officially begins service on Monday. This is a major event in the promoted economic cooperation between Beijing and Moscow and diversifies Russia&#8217;s energy exports as well as China&#8217;s energy imports. It is an achievement of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era in the economic and trade field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a total length of more than 8,000 kilometers, the pipeline is the longest natural gas pipeline in the world today. Negotiations alone over the project had been going on for 18 years. But after that, a fruitful result was quickly reached in the following years. Obviously, the process has been encouraged by the strengthening of China-Russia strategic mutual trust.</p>
<p>Once it starts to run at full capacity, the pipeline will be able to supply 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China. This accounts for 14 percent of natural gas that China consumed in 2018 and 28 percent of natural gas that China imported in the same year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, Russian natural gas was mainly delivered to Europe. Russia was supposed not to be worried about relevant exports. However, large-scale US&nbsp; exploitation of shale gas and rapid changes in global energy structure have gradually shaped a buyer&#8217;s market. Combined with the West&#8217;s sanctions against Russia, the latter&#8217;s natural gas exports to Europe face new&nbsp;&nbsp; challenges. Opening up the Chinese market will greatly improve Russia&#8217;s status in negotiations with Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a win-win cooperation between Beijing and Moscow. Strengthening collaboration between the two not only creates substantial quantities of direct benefits, but also often plays a positive role of leverage in their third-party market cooperation.</p>
<p>The comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Russia will benefit the two peoples. To befriend a distant country and be hostile to neighbors has been the usual geopolitical pattern, which is quite common in Asia. In this context, China-Russia ties have set a good example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mutual trust strengthens, the two countries will have more space for trade cooperation. Cross-border pipeline and bridge infrastructure improve the two sides&#8217; all-round cooperation. This will probably structurally affect geo-economics in the entire region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline will economically energize the places it goes through in Russia. For China, many cities will enjoy clean energy from Russia, which will help the environment in Northeast and East China.</p>
<p>China is upholding people-centered development, an idea &#8211; if internationalized &#8211; that maximizes equal and mutually beneficial cooperation among countries. The pipeline benefits the two peoples. There should be more such pipelines and bridges in the world. The mind-set that hinders such projects should be history.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> announced Monday that China would suspend reviewing applications for US warships and aircraft to make port calls in Hong Kong and will impose sanctions on five NGOs, including the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and Human Rights Watch. These measures, the first wave of countermeasures against the &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,&#8221; will have a real impact on related departments and organizations.</p>
<p>The measures demonstrate Chinese government&#8217;s determination to not allow certain US and Western forces to wantonly make waves on the Hong Kong issue. If the US side continues to provoke on Hong Kong, it is expected that China will take follow-up actions.</p>
<p>Because of &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; the US can exert some influence in Hong Kong. But Washington shouldn&#8217;t get the illusion that it can turn the influence into jurisdiction over Hong Kong, and make the city its sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The measures announced on Monday are mild, as China has exercised restraint so far, but it doesn&#8217;t mean Beijing won&#8217;t hit back with harsher measures, if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fives NGOs such as NED are closely connected to US authorities, whose funding directly or indirectly comes from US government allocations. These organizations are at the forefront of US values infiltration to advance American national interests. These organizations have played a disgraceful role in stirring social turmoil in many countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time that China has openly imposed sanctions on US NGOs, which doesn&#8217;t imply that Beijing thinks riots in Hong Kong were solely caused by external factors. But certain forces from the US did exert a disruptive impact. Sanctioning them is a naturally result of China&#8217;s national strength and sovereignty will.</p>
<p>The US side shouldn&#8217;t feel surprised by Beijing&#8217;s announcement to suspend port calls of US warships and aircraft. The US military may feel inconvenient since they traditionally stop in Hong Kong for maintenance, but they can argue with the US Congress and the White House.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The countermeasures announced on Monday also sent a clear signal to radical forces in Hong Kong that they shouldn&#8217;t count on external forces to dictate the Hong Kong situation. The city is part of China and no force can change or weaken this reality. China has abundant capability to adopt tough measures when necessary to stop external forces from causing any real harm to China&#8217;s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Liberation Army is also stationed in Hong Kong. It is not a decoration, but provides fundamental support for Hong Kong&#8217;s stability. Hong Kong, under China&#8217;s rule, connects China and the West. If the US wants to broaden communication through Hong Kong, we welcome it. But if Washington wants to abandon this platform, so be it. It is also our attitude to other Western countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Hong Kong&#8217;s tradition to connect China and the West. However, if Hong Kong society can&#8217;t stop internal disruptive forces and the city can no longer perform such a function, then the city will experience an economic structural adjustment.</p>
<p>No force should ponder the idea of undermining China&#8217;s sovereignty over Hong Kong. The path is a dead end.</p>

<p>NATO&#8217;s 70th anniversary meeting is scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday in London. Troubled by internal and external problems, the organization seems not in a mood to celebrate. The US-based Defense News even predicts that &#8220;politics could make the situation feel more like a funeral.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization is already dragged by several internal disputes such as defense budgets, and is also frustrated by external challenges, including the Middle East situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even so, Washington still seemingly considers NATO not in enough trouble and has recently started to find the organization a new enemy &#8211; Beijing.</p>
<p>On November 20, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for member states&#8217; attention to the &#8220;current and potential long-term threat&#8221; posed by China at a NATO foreign ministerial meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A senior US administration official again said Friday that the China-posed challenges, including its &#8220;dominance of 5G telecommunications networks&#8221; is a &#8220;very, very high priority&#8221; and will be discussed by President Donald Trump with allies at the NATO summit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US is building NATO as an ideology-based alliance aimed at containing China, with 5G as its major focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his European visit in September, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged NATO members to ban Chinese companies from their 5G networks. Similar statements have been made by quite a few US officials.</p>
<p>NATO has always been a tool utilized by Washington to support its own interests. The US is now attempting to draw other countries over to its side and pursue its strategic goal of keeping China down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Europe should not be fooled by US tricks. It is time for these member states to seriously consider the situations and make the right choice.</p>
<p>European nations are now faced with two options: blindly following the US or cooperating with China despite US preaching.</p>
<p>Taking sides with the US is not in line with Europe&#8217;s interests. Making this choice will only turn Europe, a significant world polar, into a US puppet. Is this a scenario the once strongest continent wants to see? And if European countries shut their door on China&#8217;s 5G technology, will they be able to bear the potential losses?</p>
<p>But recognizing the reality and cooperating with China will make a different story. In 2018, China was the second-largest partner for EU exports and the largest partner for EU imports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future cooperation will only bring more benefits to both sides. It is possible that the US will create difficulties for China-Europe collaboration, but China is ready to make efforts to strengthen exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facing the two choices, those with discerning eyes can easily tell which to choose. &#8220;Is our enemy today Russia? Or China? Is it the goal of NATO to designate them as enemies? I don&#8217;t believe so.&#8221; French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> has already made this clear.</p>
<p>What good does making an enemy do? Targeting China is a doomed way, as breaking off cooperation with the world&#8217;s second-largest economy is like self-imposed isolation. Europe should think it over.&nbsp;</p>
