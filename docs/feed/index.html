<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Electronic screen shows the closing numbers at New York Stock Exchange in New York, the United States, Dec. 3, 2019. U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors monitored the latest development of trade issues between the United States and its major trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 280.23 points, or 1.01 percent, to 27,502.81. The S&amp;P 500 fell 20.67 points, or 0.66 percent, to 3,093.20.

<br />US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors monitored the latest development of trade issues between the United States and its major trading partners.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 280.23 points, or 1.01 percent, to 27,502.81. The S&amp;P 500 fell 20.67 points, or 0.66 percent, to 3,093.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 47.34 points, or 0.55 percent, to 8,520.64.</p>
<p>Most of the 30 Dow components traded in red territory, with Intel and Dow declining 2.76 percent and 2.52 percent, respectively, leading the laggards.</p>
<p>Nine of the 11 primary S&amp;P 500 sectors traded on a downbeat note, with the energy sector losing 1.55 percent, the biggest loser.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will &#8220;restore&#8221; tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Brazil and Argentina, drawing wide concern domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>Calling the move &#8220;unexpected,&#8221; Argentine Minister of Production and Labor Dante Sica said &#8220;we still don&#8217;t know what this implies. We want to know the details and the scope of the announcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brazil Steel Institute, which represents the interests of steel exporters, said in a statement that the new tariffs would hurt not only Brazilian companies, but also U.S. steel companies, as they would need the semi-finished products imported from Brazil.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s threat to hit French products with tariffs over a taxation dispute concerning large U.S. tech companies also fueled turmoil in the stock market.</p>

<p>Huawei&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is under the spotlight from Chinese netizens again, but this time for her taste in fashion.</p>
<p>Following the one-year anniversary of Meng&#8217;s arrest in Canada on Sunday, she said in an open letter that she was &#8220;no longer afraid of the unknown&#8221; despite moments of fear and torment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her relaxed and fearless attitude has clearly influenced Chinese internet users. On social media, people have begun to pay attention to things outside of her legal proceedings &#8211; Meng&#8217;s outfits at several court appearances.</p>
<p>Some users on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo said that Meng&#8217;s ensembles when she appears in court are eye-catching and change the stereotypically conservative image of Chinese businesswomen.</p>
<p>Some fashion bloggers have listed her outfits and their corresponding brands from each public appearance.</p>
<p>One look featuring a Max Mara tobacco-colored cashmere coat, and another featuring a black Chanel coat, were compared to similar court outfits worn by former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy when she sued a paparazzo.</p>
<p>In addition to her clothes, Meng&#8217;s shoes were also widely discussed &#8211; her sparkling Jimmy Choos were a particular delight for netizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GPS monitor strapped to her ankle looks like a fashion accessory with her calm attitude and confidence,&#8221; said a fashion blogger.</p>
<p>Some netizens said that her outfits have been praised because they reflect Meng&#8217;s strong, confident spirit and positive energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her confidence and bravery should be admired, as she always holds her head high when making public appearances,&#8221; said a Sina Weibo user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Greeks, Albanians and other migrants gathered in front of the City Hall and lit up candles in memory of the dead in an event organized by the Federation of Albanian Communities in Greece with the support of the Municipality of Athens.</p>
<p>The event, which aimed to send a strong message of friendship and solidarity with Albanian people in these difficult times, was also supported by the Greek forum of migrants comprised of communities of migrants from dozens of countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We remember the 51 people who lost their lives during the quake in our country and we are in pain. We want to do anything possible to help people who have lost their loved ones, especially for children who are in a serious psychological condition,&#8221; Anna Paschali, a 50-year-old Albanian migrant who has been living in Greece for the past 25 years, told Xinhua.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Paschali is a member of an organization mobilized to assist quake-devastated Albanians. They have collected clothing items, medicine and cash to be sent to the neighboring country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing whatever we can. I would like to voice our gratitude to the City of Athens which helped us organize this event,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Governments at various levels in Greece are offering help, while labor unions, medical associations, NGOs, soccer clubs and ordinary citizens are collecting humanitarian aid to be sent to Albania.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a community here we are deeply touched by the assistance Greek people and the Greek government have provided from the first hours,&#8221; said Ermal Soulai, president of the Federation, referring to the Greek teams of experts dispatched to help rescue people from the debris.</p>

<p>Representing Albanian students in Greece, Skerdilaidi Agaliu, member of the Board of Directors in the Federation, visited Durres while search and rescue operations were still underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;The image of the town was tragic. It resembled a bombarded site. Without exaggeration a large part of the town has vanished,&#8221; he told Xinhua.</p>
<p>&#8220;(In) these difficult days, Europe and the country where we&#8217;ve been living in the past 30 years have shown that we are not alone,&#8221; Agaliu said.</p>
<p>Quake prone Greece has been hit numerous times by deadly tremors and Greek people know the pain of losing relatives, friends, neighbors and properties within brief moments.</p>
<p>Albanians represent the largest immigrant population in Greece, according to the 2011 census. Mainly since the 1990s, hundreds of thousands have been seeking a better life in Greece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />The ruling party of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has decided to hold new sessions to &#8220;discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad,&#8221; official media reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers&#8217; Party of Korea (WPK) decided on Tuesday to convene the 5th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK in late December, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>
<p>The 4th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK was held on April 10 this year.</p>
<p>With the year-end deadline set by Pyongyang for diplomacy to produce results, DPRK&#8217;s Vice Foreign Minister Ri Thae Song warned on Tuesday that the U.S. will soon need to decide what kind of &#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> gift&#8221; it will receive from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get,&#8221; Ri said in a statement carried by the KCNA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chiang Mai&#8217;s hotel room occupancy is likely to drop to about 60 percent throughout this year, according to a hotelier of Thailand&#8217;s northern tourist province.</p>
<p>La-iad Bungsrithong, chief of the Thai Hotels Association&#8217;s Northern Chapter, said on Monday that the room occupancy in all districts of Chiang Mai is believed to drop to as low as 60 percent throughout this year, compared to 75 percent last year.</p>
<p>The northern tourist province currently has an estimated 60,000 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Some 8.08 million tourists have visited Chiang Mai during this year&#8217;s first 10 months, accounting for a 1.14 percent drop from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chiang Mai&#8217;s decreased occupancy is expected to fairly rebound during the first quarter of 2020, given MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events to be organized for government personnel as well as corporate employees, La-iad said.</p>
<p>The sluggish tourism of Chiang Mai is largely attributed to the strengthened baht, prompting foreign tourists to go elsewhere, she said.</p>

<p>The Kenyan government on Tuesday confirmed that 132 people have lost their lives from rain-triggered disasters since October.</p>
<p>Cyrus Oguna, government spokesperson with Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology told journalists in Nairobi that the floods and landslides have affected 32 counties across the country, resulting in approximately 17,000 people being displaced.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the third month running, the country continues to experience unprecedented heavy rains which have triggered floods, mudslides and other calamities associated with bad weather,&#8221; Oguna said.</p>
<p>He noted that the humanitarian situation remains dire as an undetermined number of people have been marooned and are still cut off by the floods.</p>
<p>He observed that over 11,000 livestock have been swept away, with an undetermined acreage of farmlands left submerged.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government is currently implementing a number of interventions in collaboration with other actors such as the Red Cross, World Food Programme and other humanitarian agencies to assist the affected communities with food and non-food items.</p>

<p>In addition, Oguna said that a multi-agency team is assessing the extent of the damage on infrastructure and is currently undertaking repairs.</p>
<p>Oguna noted that the weather forecast has indicated that the current rains are not expected to cease until the end of December 2019 and so the government will continue monitoring the situation and undertaking appropriate intervention mechanisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are issuing an advisory that those living in the high-risk areas such as Lake Victoria Basin, Lower Tana Delta, Coastal and Central regions to move to safer areas,&#8221; said the government spokesman.</p>
<p>Additionally, he advised members of the public to avoid crossing flooded waters and avoid sheltering under trees and standing close to grilled windows to minimize safety risks from lightning strikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nigeria has started the construction of the country&#8217;s first transportation university assisted by a Chinese firm. </p>
<p>The construction of the new specialized academic institution on a 413-hectare of land is undertaken by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd, as part of its corporate social responsibility in the country. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday attended the project&#8217;s ground-breaking ceremony. </p>
<p>When completed, the University of Transportation in Daura, the birthplace of Buhari in Nigeria&#8217;s northern state of Katsina, will focus on research and development of human capital for the country&#8217;s transport sector. It is expected to mark a new level of growth, as well as economic and educational development in Africa&#8217;s largest economy. </p>

<p>The Nigerian leader, while noting the university as the first of its kind in Africa, said it will provide technical skills, enhance managerial capacity and pave way for innovation in Nigeria&#8217;s transport system, as well as create more job opportunities. </p>
<p>Buhari said the local transport sector in the country was in dire need of new thinking, skills, and investment, further assuring that the university will open up opportunities for economic growth. </p>
<p>&#8220;When established, the university would, among other things, pave way for the domestication of railway engineering and general transportation sciences in Nigeria, thereby bridging the technology and skill gap in the railway and ultimately transportation sector,&#8221; the president said. </p>
<p>He described the project as one which keys into the efforts of the Nigerian government &#8220;toward promotion and development of indigenous capacity through technology acquisition and knowledge transfer to effectively maintain and operate numerous railway infrastructure&#8221;. </p>
<p>The completion of the university&#8217;s construction is expected within 18 months. </p>
<p>Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria&#8217;s transport minister, told Xinhua in an interview that the project would go a long way to enhance the existing bilateral relationship between China and Nigeria, as well as encourage patronage of local content. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have talked about the transfer of technology. We have talked about the issue of maintenance&#8230; Being able to construct our own railways and knowledge transfer. That would be great,&#8221; Amaechi said. </p>

<p>Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony which had several top government functionaries in attendance, Zhou Pingjian, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria said the establishment of the University of Transportation was part of the ongoing effort of the Nigerian government to promote and develop the local capacity through technology acquisition in the rail transport sector. </p>
<p>Zhou also said China remained committed to working with Nigeria to implement the outcomes of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum On China-Africa Cooperation and advance the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative for common development. </p>
<p>In addition to the university&#8217;s construction, the CCECC is also currently training at least 150 young Nigerian students in railway engineering in China, as well as building a railway rolling stock assembly plant in Kajola, a town in the southwestern state of Ogun. </p>
<p>In an interview with Xinhua, Jiang Yigao, the managing director of CCECC Nigeria Ltd, which has been in operation in Nigeria since 1981, said the university project was done to fully establish the railway industry in the west African country. The Chinese firm has been handling most of Nigeria&#8217;s major railway projects, including the flagship rail modernization project. </p>
<p>&#8220;During the construction of Nigeria&#8217;s railway projects, we thought it was very important to train people, to transfer technology and to develop the industry of railway,&#8221; Jiang said. </p>
<p>&#8220;This transportation university can reach this target. The railway is in huge demand in Nigeria, especially for economic development,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday that Iran is ready to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia, official IRNA news agency reported. </p>
<p>&#8220;From Iran&#8217;s points of view, there is no problem in developing ties with neighbors and resuming relations with Saudi Arabia,&#8221; Rouhani made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi in Tehran. </p>
<p>&#8220;All the regional countries should stay together in order to create peace and stability in the region,&#8221; Rouhani was quoted as saying. </p>
<p>The Iranian president said that Iran&#8217;s Hormuz Peace Initiative is aimed at bringing regional countries together to create stability. </p>
<p>&#8220;We should establish security in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz through expanding our cooperation and preventing foreign powers to interfere,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Rouhani disclosed the initiative at the recent meeting of the 74th UN General Assembly. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Rouhani said that &#8220;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon failed to bear fruits.&#8221; He urged the Saudi authorities to change their course of action vis-a-vis regional countries. </p>
<p>Rouhani noted that Iran and Saudi Arabia need to leave aside their feud and look ahead to solve regional problems through cooperation.</p>

<p>Chief Executive of China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said Tuesday that more relief measures will be rolled out soon to help businesses and residents weather out economic hardship, following three rounds of such policies adopted during the past months.</p>
<p>As multiple data have revealed a grim economic circumstance, the HKSAR government will closely monitor the situation and carry out new relief measures, Lam told a press conference.</p>
<p>The HKSAR government has allocated about 20 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.55 billion U.S. dollars) in total since August in hopes of reviving an economy that has stepped into a technical recession.</p>

<p>GLOOMY ECONOMY</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost millions of Hong Kong dollars each month recently,&#8221; a server of a spicy crab restaurant in Causeway Bay said. At lunchtime, there were only a few diners at the restaurant that just opened in July.</p>
<p>Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said Hong Kong&#8217;s catering sector is expected to lose 17 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.17 billion U.S. dollars) from June and December, and about 400 restaurants have closed down so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;The official unemployment rate in Hong Kong&#8217;s catering industry in October is 6.1 percent, but my estimate is 7 to 7.5 percent, that is nearly 22,000 people lost their jobs in October,&#8221; he said. He was afraid that over 1,000 more restaurants may not survive the current crisis by February.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business sentiment has turned pessimistic, weighed down by external uncertainties and local violent incidents that have dragged on for months,&#8221; HKSAR government Financial Secretary Paul Chan said at a meeting of the Legislative Council, stressing that industries from tourism to catering are struggling in the bleak winter.</p>
<p>Retail sales decreased 24.3 percent from a year ago in October, the largest decline for a single month on record. Visitors to Hong Kong tumbled 43.7 percent year on year in October.</p>
<p>The economy dropped 2.9 percent in the third quarter, sharply down from the 0.4-percent growth in the second quarter.</p>

<p>PESSIMISTIC SENTIMENT</p>
<p>&#8220;Three months? Half a year? I have no idea when my life can be normal again,&#8221; a tour guide surnamed Wan said. The veteran tour guide who had gone through hard days of the financial crisis and the SARS outbreak felt that he could not make it this time.</p>
<p>With no tour groups to receive since June, Wan has started to take part-time jobs at metro stations and restaurants.</p>
<p>Tourism was one of the hardest-hit sectors by the months-long violence. &#8220;There is no sign of a recovery in December, instead a 30-to-40 percent drop in the tourism revenue will be likely,&#8221; a lawmaker and tourism industry insider Yiu Si-wing said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the situation settles down a little bit, the sector is unlikely to return to the previous level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HKSAR government has cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2019 to a negative 1.3 percent, which will be the region&#8217;s first annual decline since 2009. The unemployment rate, which has already spiked to 3.1 percent during the August-October period, will likely rise further in the coming months.</p>
<p>Hong Kong will likely register its first budget deficit in 15 years for the current fiscal year ending on March 31, as the economy has slipped into a technical recession amid the prolonged social unrest, Paul Chan said.</p>
<p>Despite possible fiscal deficits in the coming one or two years, it is high time the HKSAR government made full use of the wealth and surplus accumulated in the past to relieve the burden on residents, Carrie Lam said.</p>

<p>VIOLENCE MUST END</p>
<p>Lam said she hopes violent incidents will stop as soon as possible to give the economy a chance to recover.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed out that relief measures can only help businesses keep afloat for a longer time and it is the end of violence and the restoring of peace that will allow people to return to their normal lives and push the economy back on track.</p>
<p>Chan also expressed concerns about looming challenges to the economy in the next year and even bigger impacts on people&#8217;s livelihood, as well as the dented confidence of international investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need concerted efforts from all sectors of the community to stop violence and chaos and facilitate the economic recovery,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;So that order can be restored, residents can live a peaceful life again and businesses can operate normally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiple districts in Kowloon descended again into chaos over the weekend as rioters hijacked public events and resorted to destructive acts like building barricades on roads, setting fires and vandalizing public facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Russian Navy will receive more than 480 units of military equipment and armament this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with top defense industry managers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The list includes two submarines, 23 surface ships and support vessels, three aircraft, four coastal missile systems and more than 400 units of various missile and torpedo weapons,&#8221; Putin said.</p>
<p>He added that Russian naval strategic nuclear forces are being re-equipped with modern Borei-class submarines with Bulava ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>According to Putin, the upgraded Borei-A-class submarine Prince Vladimir is undergoing final tests, with four more under construction.</p>
<p>Ships equipped with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles form the basis of the Navy&#8217;s strategic non-nuclear forces, Putin said.</p>
<p>These missiles are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 1,500 kilometers, he said, adding Russia plans to more than double the number of these missiles by 2023.</p>
<p>Putin said that the pace of equipping the fleet with maritime zone ships is accelerating, with the construction of nine surface ships of this class currently underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, we will continue to develop the Navy, making it modern, ocean-going and highly efficient,&#8221; Putin added.&nbsp;</p>
